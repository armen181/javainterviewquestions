<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>1.	What is the difference between  JDK and JRE?</b></h1>
<p>JDK stands for Java Development Kit. It contains the tools and  libraries for development of Java programs. It also contains  compilers and debuggers needed to compile Java program,</p>
<p>JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. This is included in JDK.  JRE provides libraries and JVM that is required to run a Java  program.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>2.	What is Java Virtual Machine  (JVM)?</b></h1>
<p>Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstract machine that executes  Java Bytecode. There are different JVM for different hardware and  software platforms. So JVM is platform dependent.  JVM is  responsible for loading, verifying and executing the Bytecode on a  platform.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>3.	What are the different types of  memory areas allocated by JVM?</b></h1>
<p>In java, JVM allocates memory to different processes, methods and  objects. Some of the memory areas allocated by JVM are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ClassLoader: It is a component of JVM used to load class  files.</li>
<li>Class (Method) Area: It stores per-class structures such as</li>
<p>the runtime constant pool, field and method data, and the  code for methods.</p>
<li>Heap: Heap is created a runtime and it contains the runtime</li>
<p>data area in which objects are allocated.</p>
<li>Stack: Stack stores local variables and partial results at  runtime. It also helps in method invocation and return  value. Each thread creates a private JVM stack at the time  of thread creation.</li>
<li>Program Counter Register: This memory area contains the</li>
<p>address of the Java virtual machine instruction that is  currently being executed.</p>
<li>Native Method Stack: This area is reserved for all the</li>
<p>native methods used in the application.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>4. What is JIT compiler?</b></h1>
<p>Just In Time compiler also known as JIT compiler is used for  performance improvement in Java. It is enabled by default. It is  compilation done at execution time rather earlier.</p>
<p>Java has popularized the use of JIT compiler by including it in</p>
<p>JVM.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>5.	How Java platform is different  from other platforms?</b></h1>
<p>Java is a platform independent language. Java compiler converts  Java code in to byte code that can be interpreted by JVM. There are  JVM written for almost all the popular platforms in the world.</p>
<p>Java byte code can run on any supported platform in same way.  Where as other languages require libraries compiled for a specific  platform to run.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>6.	Why people say that Java is 'write  once and run anywhere' language?</b></h1>
<h2>You can write Java code on Windows and compile it in Windows  platform. The class and jar files that you get from Windows  platform can run as it is on Unix environment. So it is a truly  platform independent language.</h2>
<h2>Behind all this portability is Java byte code. Byte code generated by  Java compiler can be interpreted by any JVM. So it becomes much  easier to write programs in Java and expect those to run on any  platform.</h2>
<h2>Java compiler javac compiles java code and JVM java runs that  code.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>7.	How does ClassLoader work in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, ClassLoader is a class that is used to load files in JVM.  ClassLoader loads files from their physical file locations e.g.  Filesystem, Network location etc.</p>
<p>There are three main types of ClassLoaders in Java.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap ClassLoader: This is the first ClassLoader. It  loads classes from rt.jar file.</li>
<li>Extension ClassLoader: It loads class files from jre/lib/ext</li>
<p>location.</p>
<li>Application ClassLoader: This ClassLoader depends on  CLASSPATH to find the location of class files. If you  specify your jars in CLASSPATH, then this ClassLoader  will load them.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>8.	Do you think ‘main’ used for main  method is a keyword in Java?</b></h1>
<p>No, main is just a name of method. There can be multiple methods  with same name main in a class file. It is not a keyword in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>9.	Can we write main method as  public void static instead of public  static void?</b></h1>
<p>No, you cannot write it like this. Any method has to first specify the  modifiers and then the return value. The order of modifiers can  change.</p>
<p>We can write static public void main() instead of public static void  main().</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>10.In Java, if we do not specify any  value for local variables, then what  will be the default value of the local  variables?</b></h1>
<p>Java does not initialize local variables with any default value. So  these variables will be just null by default.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>11. Let say, we run a java class without  passing any arguments. What will be  the value of String array of  arguments in Main method?</b></h1>
<p>By default, the value of String array of arguments is empty in Java.  It is not null.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>12.What is the difference between  byte and char data types in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>Both byte and char are numeric data types in Java. They are used to  represent numbers in a specific range.</h2>
<h2>Major difference between them is that a byte can store raw binary  data where as a char stores characters or text data.</h2>
<h2>Usage of char is E.g. char ch = ‘x’;  Byte values range from -128 to 127.</h2>
<h2>A byte is made of 8 bits. But a char is made of 16 bits. So it is  equivalent to 2 bytes.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>OOPS</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>13.What are the main principles of  Object Oriented Programming?</b></h1>
<p>Main principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstraction</li>
<li>Encapsulation</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>14.What is the difference between  Object Oriented Programming  language and Object Based  Programming language?</b></h1>
<p>Object Oriented Programming languages like Java and C++ follow  concepts of OOPS like- Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism  and Inheritance etc.</p>
<p>Object Based Programming languages follow some features  of  OOPS but they do not provide support for Polymorphism and  Inheritance. Egg. JavaScript, VBScript etc.</p>
<p>Object Based Programming languages provide support for Objects  and you can build objects from constructor. They languages also  support Encapsulation. These are also known as Prototype-oriented  languages.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>15.In Java what is the default value of  an object reference defined as an  instance variable in an Object?</b></h1>
<p>All the instance variable object references in Java are null.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>16.Why do we need constructor in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java is an object-oriented language, in which we create and use  objects. A constructor is a piece of code similar to a method. It is  used to create an object and set the initial state of the object.</p>
<p>A constructor is a special function that has same name as class  name.</p>
<p>Without a constructor, there is no other way to create an object.</p>
<p>By default, Java provides a default constructor for every object. If  we overload a constructor then we have to implement default  constructor.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>17.Why do we need default  constructor in Java classes?</b></h1>
<h2>Default constructor is the no-argument constructor that is  automatically generated by Java if no other constructor is defined.</h2>
<h2>Java specification says that it will provide a default constructor if  there is no overloaded constructor in a class. But it does not say  anything about the scenario in which we write an overloaded  constructor in a class.</h2>
<h2>We need at least one constructor to create an object, that’s why Java  provides a default constructor.</h2>
<h2>When we have overloaded constructor, then Java assumes that we  want some custom treatment in our code. Due to which it does not  provide default constructor. But it needs default constructor as per  the specification. So it gives error.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>18.What is the value returned by  Constructor in Java?</b></h1>
<p>When we call a constructor in Java, it returns the object created by  it. That is how we create new objects in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>19.Can we inherit a Constructor?</b></h1>
<p>No, Java does not support inheritance of constructor.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>20. Why constructors cannot be final,  static, or abstract in Java?</b></h1>
<p>If we set a method as final it means we do not want any class to  override it. But the constructor (as per Java Language  Specification) cannot be overridden. So there is no use of marking it  final.</p>
<p>If we set a method as abstract it means that it has no body and it  should be implemented in a child class. But the constructor is called  implicitly when the new keyword is used. Therefore it needs a  body.</p>
<p>If we set a method as static it means that it belongs to the class, but  not a particular object. The constructor is always called to initialize  an object. Therefore, there is no use of marking constructor static.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Inheritance</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>21.What is the purpose of ‘this’  keyword in java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, ‘this’ keyword refers to current instance of the object.</p>
<p>It is useful for differentiating between instance variables and local  variables.</p>
<p>It can be used to call constructors. Or it can be used to refer to the  instance.</p>
<p>In case of method overriding, this is used for falling the method of  current class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>22. Explain the concept of  Inheritance?</b></h1>
<p>Inheritance is an important concept in Object Oriented  Programming. Some objects share certain characteristics and  behavior. By using Inheritance, we can put the common behavior  and characteristics in a base class which also known as super class.  And then all the objects with common behavior inherit from this  base class.</p>
<p>It is also represented by IS-A relationship.</p>
<p>Inheritance promotes, code reuse, method overriding and poly-  morphism.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>23. Which class in Java is superclass  of every other class?</b></h1>
<p>Java is an object oriented programming language. In Java, Object  class is the superclass of every other class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>24. Why Java does not support  multiple inheritance?</b></h1>
<p>Multiple Inheritance means that a class can inherit behavior from  two or more parent classes.</p>
<p>The issue with Multiple Inheritance is that both the parent classes  may have different implementation for the same method. So they  have different ways of doing the same thing. Now which  implementation should the child class choose?</p>
<p>This leads to ambiguity in Multiple Inheritance. This is the main  reason for Java not supporting Multiple Inheritance in  implementation.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a class TV and another class AtomBomb. Both  have method switchOn() but only TV has switchOff() method. If  your class inherits from both these classes then you have an issue  that you can switchOn() both parents, but switchOff will only  switchOff() TV.</p>
<p>But you can implement multiple interfaces in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>25. In OOPS, what is meant by  composition?</b></h1>
<p>Composition is also known as “has-a” relationship. In composition,  “has-a” relation relates two classes. E.g. Class Car has a steering  wheel.</p>
<p>If a class holds the instance of another class, then it is called  composition.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>26. How aggregation and composition  are different concepts?</b></h1>
<h2>In OOPS, Aggregation and Composition are the types of association  relations. A composition is a strong relationship. If the composite  object is destroyed, then all its parts are destroyed. E.g. A Car has a  Steering Wheel. If Car object is destroyed, then there is no meaning  of Steering Wheel.</h2>
<h2>In Aggregation, the relationship is weaker than Composition.</h2>
<h2>E.g. A Library has students. If a Library is destroyed, Students still  exist. So Library and Student are related by Aggregation. A Library  has Books. If Library is destroyed, the Books are also destroyed.  Books of a Library cannot exist without the Library. So Book and  Library are related by Composition.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>27. Why there are no pointers in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java there are references instead of pointers. These references  point to objects in memory. But there is no direct access to these  memory locations. JVM is free to move the objects within VM  memory.</p>
<p>The absence of pointers helps Java in managing memory and  garbage collection effectively. Also it provides developers with  convenience of not getting worried about memory allocation and de-  allocation.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>28. If there are no pointers in Java,  then why do we get  NullPointerException?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, the pointer equivalent is Object reference. When we use a .  it points to object reference. So JVM uses pointers but  programmers only see object references.</p>
<p>In case an object reference points to null object, and we try to  access a method or member variable on it, then we get  NullPointerException.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>29. What is the purpose of ‘super’  keyword in java?</b></h1>
<p>‘super’ keyword is used in the methods or constructor of a child  class. It refers to immediate parent class of an object.</p>
<p>By using ‘super’ we can call a method of parent class from the  method of a child class.</p>
<p>We can also call the constructor  of a parent class from the  constructor of a child class by using ‘super’ keyword.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>30. Is it possible to use this() and  super() both in same constructor?</b></h1>
<p>No, Java does not allow using both super() and this() in same  constructor. As per Java specification, super() or this() must be the  first statement in a constructor.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>31.What is the meaning of object  cloning in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Object.clone() method is used for creating an exact copy of the  object in Java. It acts like a copy constructor. It creates and returns  a copy of the object, with the same class and with all the fields  having same values as of the original object.</p>
<p>One disadvantage of cloning is that the return type is an Object. It  has to be explicitly cast to actual type.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>32. In Java, why do we use static  variable?</b></h1>
<p>Whenever we want to have a common property for all objects of a  class, we use a class level variable i.e. a static variable.</p>
<p>This variable is loaded in memory only once at the time of class  loading. So it saves memory, since it is not defined per object in  Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>33. Why it is not a good practice to  create static variables in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Static variables are common to all the objects of a class. If a new  object is created, there is no need to test the value of static variable.  Any code that uses static variable can be in any state. It can be  within a new object or at a class level. So the scope of static  variable is open ended in a Java class.</p>
<p>If we want tighter control on scope, then variables should be  created at the object creation level.</p>
<p>Also defining static variables is not a good practice because they go  against the principles of Object Oriented Programming.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>34. What is the purpose of static  method in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides the feature of static method to create behavior at the  class level. The static method is common to all the objects of a  class. We do not need to create any object of a class to call a static  method. So it provides convenience of not creating an object for  calling it.</p>
<p>Also a static method can access and modify static data members.  This also helps in keeping the behavior as well as state at the class  level.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>35. Why do we mark main method as  static in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>The main method in Java is marked as static, so that JVM can call it  to start the program. If main method is not static, then which  constructor will be called by Java process?</h2>
<h2>As such it is a known as convention to mark main method static in  Java. But if we remove the static, then there will be ambiguity. Java  process may not know which method of a class to call to start the  program.</h2>
<h2>So this convention helps in Java process to identify the starting code  for a program in class that is passed as an argument to java process.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>36. In what scenario do we use a static  block?</b></h1>
<p>At times, there is a class that has static member variables. These  variables need some complicated initialization. At this time static  block helps as a tool to initialize complex static member variable  initialization.</p>
<p>The static block is executed even before the execution of main.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we can also replace static block with a static method of  class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>37. Is it possible to execute a program  without defining a main() method?</b></h1>
<p>No, with Java 7 onwards, you need a main() method to execute a  program. In earlier versions of Java, there was a workaround  available to use static blocks for execution. But now this gap has  been closed.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>38. What happens when static  modifier is not mentioned in the  signature of main method?</b></h1>
<p>As per Java specification, main method has to be marked as static.  It needs only one argument that is an array of String.</p>
<p>A program can compile with a non-static method. But on execution  it will give NoSuchMethodError.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>39. What is the difference between  static method and instance method in  Java?</b></h1>
<h2>Often, there is a need to define a behavior for a class that is not  dependent on member variables of an object. Such behavior is  captured in a static method. If there is a behavior dependent upon  the member variables of an object, then we do not mark it static, it  remains as instance method.</h2>
<h2>To call as static method, we do not need to create an object. We just  call it with class name. But to call an instance method, we need to  create/get an object first.</h2>
<h2>Instance member variables cannot be accessed by a static method.  But an instance method can call both instance variables and static  variables.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>40. What is the other name of Method  Overloading?</b></h1>
<p>Method Overloading is also known as Static Polymorphism.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>41.How will you implement method  overloading in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, a class can have multiple methods with same name but  different arguments. It is called Method Overloading. To implement  method overloading we have to create two methods with same name  in a class and do one/more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different number of parameters</li>
<li>Different data type of parameters</li>
<li>Different sequence of data type of parameters</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>42. What kinds of argument  variations are allowed in Method  Overloading?</b></h1>
<p>Method Overloading allows two methods with same name to differ  in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of parameters</li>
<li>Data type of parameters</li>
<li>Sequence of data type of parameters</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>43. Why it is not possible to do  method overloading by changing  return type of method in java?</b></h1>
<p>If we change the return type of overloaded methods then it will lead  to ambiguous behavior. How will clients know which method will  return what type. Due to this different return type are not allowed in  overloaded methods.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>44. Is it allowed to overload main()  method in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, Java allows users to create many methods with same name  ‘main’. But only public static void main(String[] args) method is  used for execution.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>45. How do we implement method  overriding in Java?</b></h1>
<p>To override a method, we just provide a new implementation of a  method with same name in subclass. So there will be at least two  implementations of the method with same name. One  implementation is in parent class. And another implementation is in  child class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>46. Are we allowed to override a static  method in Java?</b></h1>
<p>No. Java does not allow overriding a static method. If you create a  static method with same name in subclass, then it is a new method,  not an overridden method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>47. Why Java does not allow  overriding a static method?</b></h1>
<p>To override a method, you need an instance of a class. Static method  is not associated with any instance of the class. So the concept of  overriding does not apply here.</p>
<p>Therefore, Java does not allow overriding a static method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>48. Is it allowed to override an  overloaded method?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. You can override an overloaded method in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>49. What is the difference between  method overloading and method  overriding in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Differences between method overloading and overriding are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Method	overloading	is	static	polymorphism.	Method  overriding is runtime polymorphism.</li>
<li>Method overloading occurs within the same class. Method</li>
<p>overriding	happens	in	two	classes	with	hierarchy  relationship.</p>
<li>Parameters	must	be	different	in  method	overloading.</li>
<p>Parameters must be same in method overriding.</p>
<li>Method overloading is a compile time concept. Method  overriding is a runtime concept.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>50. Does Java allow virtual functions?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. All instance methods in Java are virtual functions by default.  Only class methods and private instance methods are not virtual  methods in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>51.What is meant by covariant return  type in Java?</b></h1>
<p>A covariant return type of a method is one that can be replaced by a  &quot;narrower&quot; type when the method is overridden in a subclass.</p>
<p>Let say class B is child of class A. There is a get() method in class  A as well as class B. get() method of class A can return an instance  of A, and get() method of class B return an instance of B. Here  class B overrides get() method, but the return type is different.</p>
<p>Before Java 5, any method that overrides the method of parent class  would have same return type.</p>
<p>From Java 5 onwards, a child class can override a method of parent  class and the child class method can return an object that is child of  object return by parent class method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Polymorphism</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>52. What is Runtime Polymorphism?</b></h1>
<p>Runtime Polymorphism or Dynamic Polymorphism is the  polymorphism that exists at runtime. In case of method overriding it  is not known which method will be called at runtime. Based on the  type of object, JVM decides the exact method that should be called.</p>
<p>So at compile time it is not known which method will be called at  run time.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>53. Is it possible to achieve Runtime  Polymorphism by data members in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>No. We need to create Runtime Polymorphism by implementing  methods at two levels of inheritance in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>54. Explain the difference between  static and dynamic binding?</b></h1>
<h2>In Static binding references are resolved at compile time. In  Dynamic binding references are resolved at Run time.</h2>
<h2>E.g.</h2>
<h2>Person p = new Person();</h2>
<h2>p.walk(); // Java compiler resolves this binding at compile time.</h2>
<h2>public void walk(Object o){</h2>
<h2>((Person) o).walk(); // this is dynamic binding.</h2>
<h2>}</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Abstraction</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>55. What is Abstraction in Object  Oriented programming?</b></h1>
<p>Abstraction is the process of hiding certain implementation details  of an object and showing only essential features of the object to  outside world.</p>
<p>It is different from Abstract class in Java.</p>
<p>Abstraction process  identifies commonalities and hides the  complexity of implementation. It helps us in focusing on the  interface that we share with the outside world.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>56. How is Abstraction different from  Encapsulation?</b></h1>
<p>Abstraction happens at class level design. It results in hiding the  implementation details. Encapsulation is also known as  “Information Hiding”. An example of encapsulation is marking the  member variables private and providing getter and setter for these  member variables.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>57. What is an abstract class in Java?</b></h1>
<p>An abstract class in Java has one or more abstract methods. An  abstract method is just declared in the abstract class, but it is not  implemented.</p>
<p>An abstract class has to be extended in Java and its abstract  methods have to be implemented by a child class. Also Java does  not allow new instance of Abstract class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>58. Is it allowed to mark a method  abstract method without marking the  class abstract?</b></h1>
<p>No. Java specification says that if there is at least one abstract  method in a class, the class has to be marked abstract.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>59. Is it allowed to mark a method  abstract as well as final?</b></h1>
<p>No. It will be contradictory statement to mark a method abstract as  well as final.</p>
<p>An abstract method has to be overridden by a child class. And a  final method cannot be overridden. Therefore a method can be  either abstract or final in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>60. Can we instantiate an abstract  class in Java?</b></h1>
<p>No. We cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>61.What is an interface in Java?</b></h1>
<p>An Interface in Java is an abstract type blueprint of a class. It  contains the methods that a class must implement. It is like a  protocol.</p>
<p>It has method signatures and constant declarations.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>62. Is it allowed to mark an interface  method as static?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, from Java 8 onwards, we can define static and default methods  in an interface. Prior to Java 8, it was not allowed.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>63. Why an Interface cannot be  marked as final in Java?</b></h1>
<p>A final method cannot be overridden. But an interface method has to  be implemented by another class. So the interface method cannot be  marked as final.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>64. What is a marker interface?</b></h1>
<p>There are interfaces that do not have any data member or methods.  These interfaces are called Marker interface.</p>
<p>E.g. Serializable, Cloneable, Remote etc.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>65. What can we use instead of  Marker interface?</b></h1>
<p>We can use annotations instead of Marker interface.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>66. How Annotations are better than  Marker Interfaces?</b></h1>
<p>Annotations serve the purpose of conveying metadata about the  class to its consumers without creating a separate type for it.</p>
<p>Annotations are more powerful than a Marker interface. They allow  programmers to pass more sophisticated information to classes that  &quot;consume&quot; it.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>67. What is the difference between  abstract class and interface in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Differences between Abstract class and Interface are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>An abstract class can have implemented methods with  body (non-abstract methods). Interface has only abstract  methods. From Java  8 onwards, interface can have  static/default methods in implemented form.</li>
<li>An abstract class can have instance member variables. An</li>
<p>interface cannot have instance variables. It can only have  constants.</p>
<li>An abstract class can have a constructor. Interface cannot</li>
<p>have constructor. It has to be implemented by another  class.</p>
<li>A class can extend only one abstract class. A class can</li>
<p>implement more than one interface.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>68. Does Java allow us to use private  and protected modifiers for variables  in interfaces?</b></h1>
<p>No. All the variables in an interface are implicitly public.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>69. How can we cast to an object  reference to an interface reference?</b></h1>
<p>An Object that implements an Interface can be cast to the same  Interface. Since An Object implementing an Interface already  provides implementation for the methods of that Interface, it is  allowed to do so as per the rules of Inheritance.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Final</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>70. How can you change the value of a  final variable in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java does not allow changing the value of a final variable. Once the  value is set, it cannot be changed.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>71.Can a class be marked final in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Yes a class can be marked final in Java. Once a class is marked  final, it cannot be extended.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>72. How can we create a final method  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>To mark a method, add modifier final to that method. A final method  can not be overridden by a child class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>73. How can we prohibit inheritance  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>If you mark a class final, it cannot be extended. This will prohibit  the inheritance of that class in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>74. Why Integer class in final in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Integer class is a wrapper for int. If it is not marked final, then any  other class can extend it and modify the behavior of Integer  operations. To avoid this Integer wrapper class is marked as final.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>75. What is a blank final variable in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>When we declare a final variable without giving any initial value,  then it is called blank final variable.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>76. How can we initialize a blank final  variable?</b></h1>
<p>A blank final instance variable can be initialized in a constructor.</p>
<p>A blank final static variable can be initialized in the static block of  class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>77. Is it allowed to declare main  method as final?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, we can mark the main method as final.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Package</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>78. What is the purpose of package in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>A package is used to encapsulate a group of classes, interfaces and  sub-packages. Often, it is a hierarchical structure of storing  information. It is easier to organize the related classes and sub-  packages in this manner.</p>
<p>A Package also provides  access protection for classes and  interfaces. A package also helps in removing naming collision.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>79. What is java.lang package?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, java.lang package contains the classes that are fundamental  to the design of Java programming language. The most important  class in this package is Object class.</p>
<p>It also contains wrapper classes like- Integer, Boolean, Character  etc. It provides Math class for mathematical operations.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>80. Which is the most important class  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>It is an open-ended question with many answers. In my view, Object  class is the most important class of Java programming language. It  is the root of all the classes in Java. It provides some very  important and fundamental methods.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>81.Is it mandatory to import java.lang  package every time?</b></h1>
<p>No. By default, JVM loads it internally.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>82. Can you import same package or  class twice in your class?</b></h1>
<p>If we import same package multiple times in a class, compiler  includes it only once. So neither JVM nor Compiler gives any  error/warning on including a package multiple times.</p>
<p>If you have two classes with same name, then you may get name  collision on importing the class erroneously.</p>
<p>JVM internally loads the class only one time.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>83. What is a static import in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Static import is similar to normal import declaration. Normal  import allows us to import classes from packages without using  package qualifier. Static import allows us to import static members  from a class without using class qualifier.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>84. What is the difference between  import static com.test.Fooclass and  import com.test.Fooclass?</b></h1>
<p>First import is a static import and the second import is normal  import of a class. First import allows us to import static members of  class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Internationalization</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>85. What is Locale in Java?</b></h1>
<p>A Locale object represents a specific geographical, political, or  cultural region. It is used to locale-sensitive operations in Java.</p>
<p>It helps is following the local conventions of a country, native or  region. These conventions can be for formatting the dates, money,  numbers etc.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>86. How will you use a specific Locale  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>To use a specific Locale, we need to load that Locale. We can use  ResourceBundle.getBundle(&quot;Locale.UK&quot;) method to load a Locale.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Serialization</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>87. What is the serialization?</b></h1>
<p>Serialization is a process converting an object into a byte array.  This byte array represents the class, version and internal state of the  object. JVM can use this byte array to transmit/read the object over  a network.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>88. What is the purpose of  serialization?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the uses of serialization are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication: It is used for transmitting an object over  network between two machines.</li>
<li>Persistence: We can store the object’s state in a database</li>
<p>and retrieve it from database later on.</p>
<li>Caching: Serialization can be used for caching to improve  performance. We may need 10 minutes to build an object,  but it may take just 10 seconds to de-serialize the object.</li>
<li>Cross JVM Synchronization:  It can be  used in same way</li>
<p>across multiple JVM that follow different architecture.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>89. What is Deserialization?</b></h1>
<p>Deserialization is the process of reconstructing the object from the  serialized state. It is the reverse process of serialization.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>90. What is Serialization and  Deserialization conceptually?</b></h1>
<p>Serialization is to convert Object data into a stream of bytes</p>
<p>Deserialization is to convert a stream of bytes back into a copy of  the original object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>91.Why do we mark a data member  transient?</b></h1>
<p>Member variables of an object are marked transient to indicate that  they should not be serialized.</p>
<p>During	serialization	process	the	transient	variables	are	not  considered part of the persistent state of an object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>92. Is it allowed to mark a method as  transient?</b></h1>
<p>No, Java does not allow marking a method as transient.  The  transient keyword is valid only for member variables.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>93. How does marking a field as  transient makes it possible to serialize  an object?</b></h1>
<p>Let say we have  a class ABC that implements Serializable  interface, but it contains a member variable object of class XYZ  that does not implement Serializable interface. Due to this it is not  possible to Serialize the class ABC.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, we can mark the member variable XYZ as  Transient in class ABC. This will allow us to serialize the class  ABC.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>94. What is Externalizable interface  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Externalizable interface extends Serializable interface in Java. It is  used for giving the Class control over saving and restoring the  contents of its instances.</p>
<p>A class implements methods writeExternal() and readExternal() to  store and restore the object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>95. What is the difference between  Serializable and Externalizable  interface?</b></h1>
<p>Serializable is a marker interface but Externalizable is not a marker  interface.</p>
<p>When we implement Serializable interface, the class is serialized  automatically by default.  We can override writeObject() and  readObject()methods to control more complex object Serialization  process.</p>
<p>In case of Externalizable, we use readExternal() and  writeExternal() methods to give control to class for  class's  serialization process.</p>
<p>Serializable interface is based on recursive algorithm.</p>
<p>Serializable gives you two options. One option is to provide custom  way of serialization, the other default way. In Externalizable, you  have to always implement readExternal() and writeExternal()  methods.</p>
<p>A public no-arg constructor is needed while using Externalizable  interface.</p>
<p>In Serialization, we need to define serialVersionUID. If it is not  explicitly defined it will be generated automatically based on all the  fields, methods of the class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Reflection</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>96. What is Reflection in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Reflection is Java language's ability to inspect and dynamically call  classes, methods, attributes etc. at Runtime. It helps in examining or  modifying the Runtime behavior of a class at Runtime.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>97. What are the uses of Reflection in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Reflection is often used in Testing, Debugging and in Integrated  Development Environment (IDE).</p>
<p>Reflection allows you to write programs that do not have to &quot;know&quot;  everything at compile time. It makes programs more dynamic, since  they can be tied together at runtime.</p>
<p>Many modern frameworks like Spring etc. use Reflection. Some  modern languages like Python etc. also use Reflection.</p>
<p>JAVA API for XML Parsing (JAXP) also uses Reflection.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>98. How can we access private  method of a class from outside the  class?</b></h1>
<p>We can use Reflection to access private method of a class from  outside the class. IN Java, we use getDeclaredMethod() to get  instance of a private method. Then we mark this method accessible  and finally invoke it.</p>
<p>In   following   sample	code,	we	are	accessing   private	method  message() of class Foo by Reflection.</p>
<p>FileName: Foo.java  public class Foo {</p>
<p>private void message(){System.out.println(&quot;hello java&quot;); }</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>FileName: FooMethodCall.java  import java.lang.reflect.Method;  public class FooMethodCall{</p>
<p>public static void main(String[] args)throws Exception{</p>
<p>Class c = Class.forName(&quot;Foo&quot;);  Object o= c.newInstance();</p>
<p>Method m =c.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;message&quot;, null);</p>
<p>m.setAccessible(true);  m.invoke(o, null);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>99. How can we create an Object  dynamically at Runtime in Java?</b></h1>
<p>We can use Reflection to create an Object dynamically at Runtime  in Java. We can use Class.newInstance() or  Constructor.newInstance() methods for creating such Objects.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Garbage Collection</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>100.What is Garbage Collection in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java has an internal mechanism called Garbage collection to  reclaim the memory of unused projects at run time.</p>
<p>Garbage	collection	is	also	known	as	automatic	memory  management.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>101. Why Java provides Garbage  Collector?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, there are no pointers. Memory management and allocation  is done by JVM. Since memory allocation is automated, after some  time JVM may go low on memory. At that time, JVM has to free  memory from unused objects. To help with the process of  reclaiming memory, Java provides an automated process called  Garbage Collector.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>102.What is the purpose of gc() in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides two methods System.gc() and Runtime.gc() to request  the JVM to run the garbage collection. By using these methods,  programmers can explicitly send request for Garbage Collection.  But JVM process can reject this request and wait for some time  before running the GC.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>103.How does Garbage Collection  work in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java has an automated process  called Garbage Collector for  Memory Management. It is a daemon in JVM that monitors the  memory usage and performs memory cleanup. Once JVM is low on  memory, GC  process finds the unused objects that are not  referenced by other objects. These unused objects are cleaned up by  Garbage Collector daemon in JVM.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>104.	When does an object become  eligible for Garbage Collection in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>An object can be Garbage Collected by JVM, if it is not reachable.  There are two cases for deciding eligibility of objects for Garbage  Collection:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Object/instance that cannot be reached by a live thread.</li>
<li>A set of circularly referenced instances that cannot be  reached by any other instance outside that set.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>105.Why do we use finalize() method  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides finalize() method to perform any cleanup before  Garbage Collection. This method is in Object class, and it is  invoked by JVM internally. Developers are free to implement this  method for any custom cleanup in case of Garbage Collection.</p>
<p>If an Object is not Garbage Collected, then this method may not be  called.</p>
<p>This method is never invoked more than once by JVM.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>106.What are the different types of  References in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, there are four types of references:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong Reference</li>
<li>Soft Reference</li>
<li>Weak Reference</li>
<li>Phantom Reference</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>107.How can we reference an  unreferenced object again?</b></h1>
<p>We can provide implementation in finalize() method to reference  and unreferenced object. For an unreferenced object, finalize()  method is called at the time of Garbage Collection. At this time,  Object can pass its reference ‘this’ to finalize() method and revive  itself.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>108.What kind of process is the  Garbage collector thread?</b></h1>
<p>Garbage Collection is a Daemon process in JVM. It is an internal  process that keep  checking Memory usage and cleans up the  memory.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>109.What is the purpose of the  Runtime class?</b></h1>
<p>The purpose of the Runtime class is to provide access to the Java  Runtime system. This class provides certain important methods like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runtime.freeMemory() – This method returns the value of  free memory in JVM</li>
<li>Runtime.maxMemory() - This method returns the value of  maximum memory that JVM can use.</li>
<li>Runtime.gc() – This method can invoke garbage collection.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>110. How can we invoke an external  process in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides the method Runtime.getRuntime().exec() to invoke an  external process from JVM.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>111. What are the uses of Runtime  class?</b></h1>
<p>Runtime class in Java provides following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows to read data via key board</li>
<li>It can use system properties and environment variables</li>
<li>It helps in running non-java programs from within a java  application.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Inner Classes</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>112.What is a Nested class?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, a Nested class is a class declared inside another class. We  can have more than one class declared inside a file.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>113. How many types of Nested classes  are in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides four types of Nested classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Member inner class</li>
<li>Local inner class</li>
<li>Anonymous inner class</li>
<li>Static nested class</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>114.Why do we use Nested Classes?</b></h1>
<p>There are following reasons for using nested classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical Grouping: We can logically group classes in one  place. If one class is useful to only one other class, then  we put smaller class within the larger class and keep them  in one file. This kind of nesting &quot;helper classes&quot; in a top-  level class makes the package more streamlined.</li>
<li>Encapsulation: Nested classes increase encapsulation. Let  say there are two top-level classes, Foo and Bar. Bar  needs access to private members of Foo. We can hide  class Bar within class Foo. In this way, private members  of Foo can be accessed by class Bar. So class Foo remains  encapsulated. Also, class Bar remains hidden from the  outside world.</li>
<li>Code Clarity: Nested classed make the code more  readable and well organized. Only Top-level classes are  exposed. The helper classes are kept hidden and closer the  code where it is used by a Top-level class.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>115.What is the difference between a  Nested class and an Inner class in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>An Inner class in Java is non-static class. It is a type of Nested class  that is defined in another class but not qualified with a Static  modifier. A Nested class is also a class can be Static Nested class  or a non-Static Inner class.</p>
<p>An Inner class has access to other members of the enclosing class,  even if they are declared private. A Static Nested class can not  access the other members of the enclosing class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>116. What is a Nested interface?</b></h1>
<p>A Nested interface is declared inside another interface or a top-  level class. By default it is static.</p>
<p>A Nested interface is also known as Static interface.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>117. How can we access the non-final  local variable, inside a Local Inner  class?</b></h1>
<p>Java allows a Local Inner class to access only Constant local  members. So we have to make the non-final local variable as final  constant to access it inside a Local Inner class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>118.Can an Interface be defined in a  Class?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, we can define a Static Nested interface within a class. Only the  enclosing class can access it.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>119.Do we have to explicitly mark a  Nested Interface public static?</b></h1>
<p>A Nested Interface is implicitly public static. So the modifiers  public and static are redundant in declaration.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>120.Why do we use Static Nested  interface in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Only the enclosing class can access a Static Nested interface.  Consider following code in which interface Xyz is enclosed in  class Abc.</p>
<p>public class Abc {  public interface Xyz {</p>
<p>void callback();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public static void registerCallback(Xyz xyz) {...}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>// Client Code  Abc.registerCallback(new Abc.Xyz() {</p>
<p>public void callback() {...}</p>
<p>});</p>
<p>Any code that cannot access Abc can not access interface Xyz also.</p>
<p>So the purpose of declaring an Inner interface is to restrict its  access from outside world.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>121.What is the meaning of  Immutable in the context of String  class in Java?</b></h1>
<p>An Immutable object cannot be modified or changed in Java. String  is an Immutable class in Java.</p>
<p>Once a String object is created, it cannot be changed. When we  assign the String to a new value, a new object is created.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>122.Why a String object is considered  immutable in java?</b></h1>
<h2>Java language uses String for a variety of purposes. For this it has  marked String Immutable.</h2>
<h2>There is a concept of String literal in Java.</h2>
<h2>Let say there are 2 String variables A and B that reference to a  String object “TestData”. All these variables refer to same String  literal. If one reference variable A changes the value of the String  literal from “TestData” to “RealData”, then it will affect the other  variable as well. Due to which String is considered Immutable. In  this case, if one variable A changes the value to “RealData”, then a  new String literal with “RealData” is created and A will point to  new String literal. While B will keep pointing to “TestData”</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>123.How many objects does following  code create?</b></h1>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>String s1=&quot;HelloWorld&quot;;  String s2=&quot; HelloWorld &quot;;  String s3=&quot; HelloWorld &quot;;</p>
<p>The above code creates only one object. Since there is only one  String Literal “HelloWorld” created, all the references point to  same object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>124.	How many ways are there in  Java to create a String object?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides two ways to create a String object. One is by using  String Literal, the other is by using new operator.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>125.How many objects does  following code create?</b></h1>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>String s = new String(&quot;HelloWorld&quot;);</p>
<p>The above code creates two objects. One object is created in String  constant pool and the other is created on the heap in non-pool area.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>126.What is String interning?</b></h1>
<p>String interning refers to the concept of using only one copy of a  distinct String value that is Immutable.</p>
<p>It provides the advantage of making String processing efficient in  Time as well as Space complexity. But it introduces extra time in  creation of String.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>127.Why Java uses String literal  concept?</b></h1>
<p>Java uses String literal concept to make Java more efficient in  memory. If same String already exists in String constant pool, it can  be reused. This saves memory usage.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>128. What is the basic difference  between a String and StringBuffer  object?</b></h1>
<p>String is an immutable object. Its value cannot change after creation.  StringBuffer is a mutable object. We can keep  appending or  modifying the contents of a StringBuffer in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>129.How will you create an immutable  class in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, we can declare a class final to make it immutable. There  are following detailed steps to make it Immutable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add final modifier to class to prevent it from getting  extended</li>
<li>Add private modifier to all the fields to prevent direct</li>
<p>access</p>
<li>Do not provide any setter methods for member variables</li>
<li>Add final modifier to all the mutable fields to assign value  only once</li>
<li>Use Deep Copy to initialize all the fields by a constructor</li>
<li>In clone method, return a copy of object instead of the  actual object reference</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>130.What is the use of toString()  method in java ?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, Object class has toString() method. This method can be  used to return the String representation of an Object. When we print  an object, Java implicitly calls toString() method.</p>
<p>Java provides a default implementation for toString() method. But  we can override this method to return the format that we want to  print.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>131. Arrange the three classes String,  StringBuffer and StringBuilder in the  order of efficiency for String  processing operations?</b></h1>
<p>StringBuilder is the most efficient class. It does not have  the  overhead of Synchronization. StringBuffer is a Synchronized class.  It has better performance  than String but it is slower than  StringBuilder. String is the slowest for any String processing  operations, since it is leads to creation of new String literal with  each modification.</p>
<p>So the decreasing order of efficiency is: StringBuilder, StringBuffer,  String</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Exception Handling</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>132.What is Exception Handling in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides Exception Handling mechanism to handle Runtime  errors that occur in JVM. There are checked exceptions in a  program that we expect to occur in certain situations.</p>
<p>Exception handling mechanism catches these checked exceptions  and takes relevant actions.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>133.In Java, what are the differences  between a Checked and Unchecked?</b></h1>
<p>Checked Exceptions extend Throwable class, but they do not extend  RuntimeException or Error classes. UncheckedException extend  RuntimeException class.</p>
<p>Checked Exceptions are checked at compile time in Java.  Unchecked Exceptions happen at Runtime, so they are not checked  at compile time.</p>
<p>IOException, SQLException etc. are examples of Checked  Exceptions. NullPointerException, ArithmeticException etc. are  examples of Unchecked Exceptions.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>134.	What is the base class for  Error and Exception classes in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Error as well as Exception class is derived from Throwable class  in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>135.What is a finally block in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides a finally block with a try block. This is an optional  block. But finally block is always executed after the execution of try  block.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>136.What is the use of finally block in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>As per Java specification, a finally block is always executed,  whether an error occurs or not, whether an exception is handled or  not. It helps in doing the cleanup like- Rollback Transaction, Close  Connection, Close a file etc.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>137.Can we create a finally block  without creating a catch block?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. A finally block can follow a try block or catch block. So we  can defined a finally block just after a try block.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>138.Do we have to always put a catch  block after a try block?</b></h1>
<p>Java does not enforce the rule to put a catch block after try block.  We can write catch block or finally block after a try block.</p>
<p>Any exception that we want to catch is mentioned in catch block.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>139.In what scenarios, a finally block  will not be executed?</b></h1>
<p>There are two main scenarios in which finally block is not  executed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Program exits by calling system.exit() call.</li>
<li>A fatal error causes JVM to crash.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>140.	Can we re-throw an Exception  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, Java allows to re-throw an Exception.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>141.What is the difference between  throw and throws in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides throw keyword to throw an exception from a method  or a static block. Java provides throws keyword to mention the  probable exception thrown by a method in its declaration.</p>
<p>We use throw to explicitly throw an exception. We used  throws to declare an exception in method definition.</p>
<p>We cannot propagate checked exceptions with throw only. But  checked exceptions can be propagated with throws keyword.</p>
<p>A throw call is followed by an instance. Class or Exception follows  a throws keyword.</p>
<p>Call to throw occurs within a method. throws is just used with  method signature.</p>
<p>We can throw only one exception at a time. But we can mention as  many exceptions in throws clause.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>142.	What is the concept of  Exception Propagation?</b></h1>
<p>In Exception Propagation, uncaught exceptions are propagated in the  call stack until stack becomes empty. This propagation is called  Exception Propagation.</p>
<p>Let say an exception propagates from one method to another method.  A() calls B(), which calls C(), which calls D(). And if D() throws  an exception, the exception will propagate from D to C to B to A,  unless one of the methods catches the exception.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>143.	When we override a method in  a Child class, can we throw an  additional Exception that is not  thrown by the Parent class method?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, Java allows us to throw additional Exception in a child class,  but the additional exception should be an unchecked exception  (RuntimeException).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Java Collection</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>144.	What is the difference between  Collection and Collections  Framework in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, a Collection is an object that contains multiple elements of  same type in a single unit. These multiple elements can be accessed  through one Collection object.</p>
<p>In Java Collections Framework is a library that provides common  architecture for creating, updating and accessing different types of  collections. In Collections framework there are common methods  that are frequently used by developers for working on a Collection  object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>145.	What are the main benefits of  Collections Framework in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Main benefits of Collections Framework in Java are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reusability: Java Collections Framework provides  common classes and utility methods than can be used with  different types of collections. This promotes the reusability  of the code. A developer does not have to re-invent the  wheel by writing the same method again.</li>
<li>Quality: Using Java Collection Framework improves the  program quality, since the code is already tested and used  by thousands of developers.</li>
<li>Speed: Most of programmers report that their development  speed increased since they can focus on core logic and use  the generic collections provided by Java framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>4.	Maintenance:	Since</p>
<p>most	of	the	Java	Collections</p>
<p>framework code is open source and API documents is  widely available, it is easy to maintain the code written  with the help of Java Collections framework. One  developer can easily pick the code of previous developer.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>146.	What is the root interface of  Collection hierarchy in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>The root interface of Collection hierarchy in Java is Collection  interface.</h2>
<h2>But the Collection interface extends Iterable interface. Due to this  some people consider Iterable interface as the root interface.</h2>
<h2>Iterable interface is present in java.lang package but Collection  interface is present in java.util package. Oracle Java API docs  mention that Collection interface is a member of the Java  Collections framework.</h2>
<h2>Whereas, Iterable interface is not stated as a part of Java  Collections framework in Java docs.</h2>
<h2>Due to this Collection interface is the root  of Collections  Framework.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>147.	What are the main differences  between Collection and Collections?</b></h1>
<p>Main   differences	between   Collection   and	Collections	are	as  follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collection is an interface in Java. But Collections is a  class in Java.</li>
<li>Collection is a base interface. Collections is a utility class  in Java.</li>
<li>Collection defines methods that are used for data structures  that contain the objects. Collections defines the methods  that are used for operations like access, find etc. on a  Collection.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>148.	What are the Thread-safe  classes in Java Collections  framework?</b></h1>
<p>The Thread-safe classes in Java Collections framework are:</p>
<p>Stack  Properties  Vector  Hashtable  BlockingQueue  ConcurrentMap</p>
<p>ConcurrentNavigableMap</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>149.	How will you efficiently  remove elements while iterating a  Collection?</b></h1>
<p>The right way to remove elements from a collection while iterating  is by using ListIterator.remove() method.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>ListIterator&lt;Integer&gt; iter = myList.iterator();  while(iter.hasNext()) {</p>
<p>itr.remove();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Some developers use following code to remove an element which is  incorrect:</p>
<p>Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; iter = myList.iterator();  while(iter.hasNext()) {</p>
<p>itr.remove();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>By doing so we get ConcurrentModificationException.</p>
<p>An iterator is first created to traverse the list. But at the same time  the list is changed by remove() method.</p>
<p>In Java, it is not allowed for a thread to modify a collection while  another thread is iterating it. ListIterator provides the capability of  removing an object during traversal.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>150.How will you convert a List into  an array of integers like- int[]?</b></h1>
<p>We can use ArrayUtils class in Apache Commons Lang library.</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>ArrayUtils.toPrimitive(myList.toArray(new</p>
<p>Sample code is:  int[]intArray  Integer[0]));</p>
<p>If we use List.toArray(), it will convert List to Integer[].</p>
<p>Another option is:</p>
<p>int[] intArray = new int[myList.size()];  for (int i=0; i &lt; myList.size(); i++) {  intArray [i] = myList.get(i);</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>151.How will you convert an array of  primitive integers int[] to a List  collection?</b></h1>
<p>We can use ArrayUtils in Apache Commons Lang library for this  purpose.</p>
<p>Sample code is:</p>
<p>List intList = Arrays.asList(ArrayUtils.toObject(intArray));</p>
<p>The other option would be to use a for loop and explicitly adding  integers to a List.</p>
<p>Sample code is:  int[]intArray = {10,20,30};</p>
<p>List&lt;Integer&gt; intList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();</p>
<p>for (int i: intArray) {  intList.add(i);</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>152.How will you run a filter on a  Collection?</b></h1>
<p>We can use CollectionUtils of Apache for this purpose. We will  have to create a Predicate that will define the condition for our  filter. Then we can apply this Predicate in filter() method.</p>
<p>Sample code is:</p>
<p>In this example we filter any names that are less than 5 characters  long.</p>
<p>List&lt;String&gt; namesList = asList( &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Green&quot; );</p>
<p>List&lt;String&gt; shortNamesList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();  shortNamesList.addAll( namesList );</p>
<p>CollectionUtils.filter( shortNamesList, new Predicate(){  public boolean evaluate( Object input ) {</p>
<p>return ((String) input).length() &lt; 5;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>} );</p>
<p>We can also use Google Guava library for this.</p>
<p>In Java 8, we can use Predicate to filter a Collection through  Stream.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>153.How will you convert a List to a  Set?</b></h1>
<p>There are two ways to convert a List to a Set in Java.</p>
<p>Option 1: Use HashSet</p>
<p>Set&lt;Integer&gt; mySet = new HashSet&lt;Integer&gt;(myList);</p>
<p>In this case we put a list into a HashSet. Internally hashCode()  method is used to identify duplicate elements.</p>
<p>Option 2: Use TreeSet</p>
<p>In this case we use our own comparator to find duplicate objects.</p>
<p>Set&lt;Integer&gt; mySet = new TreeSet&lt;Integer&gt;(myComparator);  mySet.addAll(myList);</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>154.	How will you remove duplicate  elements from an ArrayList?</b></h1>
<p>The trick in this question is to use a collection that does not allow  duplicate elements. So we use a Set for this purpose.</p>
<p>Option 1: Use Set</p>
<p>If ordering of elements is not important then we just put the elements  of ArrayList in a HashSet and then add them back to the ArrayList.</p>
<p>Sample Code is:</p>
<p>ArrayList myList = // ArrayList with duplicate elements  Set&lt;Integer&gt; mySet = new HashSet&lt;Integer&gt;(myList);  myList.clear();</p>
<p>myList.addAll(mySet);</p>
<p>Option 2: Use LinkedHashSet</p>
<p>If ordering of elements is important then we put the elements of  ArrayList in a LinkedHashSet and then add them back to the  ArrayList.</p>
<p>Sample Code is:</p>
<p>ArrayList myList = // ArrayList with duplicate elements  Set&lt;Integer&gt; mySet = new LinkedHashSet&lt;Integer&gt;(myList);  myList.clear();</p>
<p>myList.addAll(mySet);</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>155.How can you maintain a  Collection with elements in Sorted  order?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, there are many ways to maintain a Collection with elements  in sorted order.</p>
<p>Some collections like TreeSet store elements in the natural  ordering. In case of natural ordering we have to implement  Comparable interface for comparing the elements.</p>
<p>We can also maintain custom ordering by providing a custom  Comparator to a Collection.</p>
<p>Another option is to use the utility method Collections.sort() to sort  a List. This sorting gives nlog(n) order of performance. But if we  have to use this method multiple times then it will be costly on  performance.</p>
<p>Another option is to use a PriorityQueue that provides an ordered  queue. The main difference between PriorityQueue and  Collections.sort() is that PriorityQueue maintains a queue in Order  all the time, but we can only retrieve head element from queue. We  cannot access the elements of PriorityQueue in Random order.</p>
<p>We can use TreeSet to maintain sorted order of elements in  collection if there are no duplicate elements in collection.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>156.What are the differences between  the two data structures: a Vector and  an ArrayList?</b></h1>
<p>An ArrayList is a newer class than a Vector. A Vector is considered a  legacy class in Java. The differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synchronization: Vector is synchronized, but the ArrayList  is not synchronized. So an ArrayList has faster operations  than a Vector.</li>
<li>Data Growth: Internally both an ArrayList and Vector use</li>
<p>an array to store data. When an ArrayList is almost full it  increases its size by 50% of the array size. Whereas a  Vector increases it by doubling the underlying array size.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>157.What are the differences between  Collection and Collections in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between Collection and Collections are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type: Collection is an interface in Java. Collections is a  class.</li>
<li>Features: Collection interface provides basic features of</li>
<p>data structure to List, Set and Queue interfaces.  Collections is a utility class to sort and synchronize  collection elements. It has polymorphic algorithms to  operate on collections.</p>
<li>Method Type: Most of the methods in Collection are at</li>
<p>instance level. Collections class has mainly static methods  that can work on an instance of Collection.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>158.	In which scenario, LinkedList  is better than ArrayList in Java?</b></h1>
<p>ArrayList is more popular than LinkedList in Java due to its ease of  use and random access to elements feature.</p>
<p>But LinkedList is better in the scenario when we do not need  random access to elements or there are a lot of insertion, deletion of  elements.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>159.What are the differences between  a List and Set collection in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between a List and a Set are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order: List collection is an ordered sequence of elements.  A Set is just a distinct collection of elements that is  unordered.</li>
<li>Positional Access: When we use a List, we can specify  where exactly we want to insert an element. In a Set there  is no order, so we can insert element anywhere without  worrying about order.</li>
<li>Duplicate: In a List we can store duplicate elements. A Set  can hold only unique elements.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>160.What are the differences between  a HashSet and TreeSet collection in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between a HashSet and TreeSet are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordering: In a HashSet elements are stored in a random  order. In a TreeSet, elements are stored according to  natural ordering.</li>
<li>Null Value Element: We can store null value object in a  HashSet. A TreeSet does not allow to add a null value  object.</li>
<li>Performance: HashSet performs basic operations like  add(), remove(), contains(), size() etc in a constant size  time. A TreeSet performs these operations at the order of  log(n) time.</li>
<li>Speed: A HashSet is better than a TreeSet in performance  for most of operations like add(), remove(), contains(),  size() etc .</li>
<li>Internal Structure: a HashMap in Java internally backs a  HashSet. A NavigableMap backs a TreeSet internally.</li>
</ul>
<p>6.	Features:	A</p>
<p>TreeSet has more features compared to a</p>
<p>HashSet. It has methods like pollFirst(), pollLast(), first(),  last(), ceiling(), lower() etc.</p>
<p>7.	Element Comparison: A HashSet uses equals() method for  comparison.   A  TreeSet  uses	compareTo()	method for</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>161. In Java, how will you decide when  to use a List, Set or a Map collection?</b></h1>
<ul>
<li>If we want a Collection that does not store duplicate  values, then we use a Set based collection.</li>
<li>If we want to frequently access elements operations based</li>
<p>on an index value then we use a List based collection. E.g.  ArrayList</p>
<li>If we want to maintain the insertion order of elements in a  collection then we use a List based collection.</li>
<li>For fast search operation based on a key, value pair, we  use a HashMap based collection.</li>
<li>If we want to maintain the elements in a sorted order, then  we use a TreeSet based collection.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>162.What are the differences between  a HashMap and a Hashtable in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between a HashMap and a Hashtable are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synchronization: HashMap is not a synchronized  collection. If it is used in multi-thread environment, it may  not provide thread safety. A Hashtable is a synchronized  collection. Not more than one thread can access  a  Hashtable at a given moment of time. The thread that  works on Hashtable acquires a lock on it and it makes  other threads wait till its work is completed.</li>
<li>Null values: A HashMap allows only one null key and any  number of null values. A Hashtable does not allow null  keys and null values.</li>
<li>Ordering: A HashMap implementation by LinkedHashMap  maintains the insertion order of elements. A TreeMap sorts  the mappings based on the ascending order of keys. On the  other hand, a Hashtable does not provide guarantee of any  kind of order  of elements. It does not maintain the  mappings of key values in any specific order.</li>
<li>Legacy: Hashtable was not the initial part of collection  framework in Java. It has been made a collection  framework member, after being retrofitted to implement the  Map interface. A HashMap implements Map interface and  is a part of collection framework since the beginning.</li>
<li>Iterator: The Iterator of HashMap is a fail-fast and it  throws ConcurrentModificationException if any other  Thread modifies the map by inserting or removing any  element except iterator’s own remove() method.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>163.What are the differences between  a HashMap and a TreeMap?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between a HashMap and a TreeMap in Java are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order: A HashMap does not maintain any order of its keys.  In a HashMap there is no guarantee that the element  inserted first will be retrieved first.</li>
<li>In a TreeMap elements are stored according to natural  ordering of elements. A TreeMap uses compareTo()  method to store elements in a natural order.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.	Internal	Implementation:</p>
<p>A	HashMap	uses	Hashing</p>
<p>internally. A TreeMap internally uses Red-Black tree  implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Parent Interfaces: A HashMap implements Map interface.  TreeMap implements NavigableMap interface.</li>
<li>Null values: A HashMap can store one null key and  multiple null values. A TreeMap can not contain null key  but it may contain multiple null values.</li>
<li>Performance: A HashMap gives constant time performance  for operations like get() and put(). A TreeMap gives order  of log(n) time performance for get() and put() methods.</li>
<li>Comparison: A HashMap uses equals() method to compare  keys. A TreeMap uses compareTo() method for  maintaining natural ordering.</li>
</ul>
<p>8. Features: A TreeMap has more features than a HashMap. It  has methods like pollFirstEntry() , pollLastEntry() ,  tailMap() , firstKey() , lastKey() etc. that are not provided  by a HashMap.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>164.	What are the differences  between Comparable and  Comparator?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between Comparable and Comparator are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type: Comparable&lt;T&gt; is an interface in Java where T is  the type of objects that this object may be compared to.</li>
<li>Comparator&lt;T&gt; is also an interface where T is the type of  objects that may be compared by this comparator.</li>
<li>Sorting: In Comparable, we can only create one sort  sequence. In Comparator we can create multiple sort  sequences.</li>
<li>Method Used:  Comparator&lt;T&gt; interface in Java  has  method public int compare (Object o1, Object o2) that  returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer when  the object o1 is less than, equal to, or greater than the  object o2. A Comparable&lt;T&gt; interface has method public  int compareTo(Object o) that returns a negative integer,  zero, or a positive integer when this object is less than,  equal to, or greater than the object o.</li>
<li>Objects for Comparison: The Comparator compares two  objects given to it as input. Comparable interface  compares &quot;this&quot; reference with the object given as input.</li>
<li>Package location: Comparable interface in Java is defined  in java.lang package. Comparator interface in Java is  defined in java.util package.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>165.In Java, what is the purpose of  Properties file?</b></h1>
<p>A Properties file in Java is a list of key-value pairs that can be  parsed by java.util.Properties class.</p>
<p>Generally a Properties file has extension  .properties e.g.  myapp.properties.</p>
<p>Properties files are used for many purposes in all kinds of Java  applications. Some of the uses are to store configuration, initial  data, application options etc.</p>
<p>When we change the value of a key in a properties file, there is no</p>
<p>need to recompile the Java application. So it provides benefit of  changing values at runtime.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>166.What is the reason for overriding  equals() method?</b></h1>
<h2>The equals() method in Object class is used to check whether two  objects are same or not. If we want a custom implementation we can  override this method.</h2>
<h2>For example, a Person class has first name, last name and age. If we  want two Person objects to be equal based on name and age, then  we can override equals() method to compare the first name, last  name and age of Person objects.</h2>
<h2>Generally in HashMap implementation, if we want to use an object  as key, then we override equals() method.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>167.How does hashCode() method  work in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Object class in Java has hashCode() method. This method returns a  hash code value, which is an integer.</p>
<p>The hashCode() is a native method and its implementation is not  pure Java.</p>
<p>Java doesn't generate hashCode(). However, Object generates a  HashCode based on the memory address of the instance of the  object.</p>
<p>If two objects are same then their hashCode() is also same.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>168.Is it a good idea to use Generics  in collections?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. A collection is a group of elements put together in an order or  based on a property. Often the type of element can vary. But the  properties and behavior of a Collection remains same. Therefore it  is good to create a Collection with Generics so that it is type-safe  and it can be used with wide variety of elements.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>169.What is the difference between  Collections.emptyList() and creating  new instance of Collection?</b></h1>
<p>In both the approaches, we get an empty list. But  Collections.emptyList() returns an Immutable list. We cannot add  new elements to an Immutable empty list.</p>
<p>Collections.emptyList() works like Singleton pattern. It does not  create a new instance of List. It reuses an existing empty list  instance.</p>
<p>Therefore, Collections.emptylist() gives better performance if we  need to get an emptyList multiple times.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>170.How will you copy elements from  a Source List to another list?</b></h1>
<p>There are two options to copy a Source List to another list.</p>
<p>Option 1: Use ArrayList constructor</p>
<p>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; newList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(sourceList);  Option 2: Use Collection.copy()</p>
<p>To use Collections.copy() destination list should be of same or  larger size than source list.</p>
<p>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</p>
<p>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;	newList	=	new  (sourceList.size());  Collections.copy(newList, sourceList);</p>
<p>Collections.copy() does not reallocate the capacity of destination  List if it does not have enough space to contain all elements of  source List. It throws IndexOutOfBoundsException.</p>
<p>The benefit of Collection.copy() is that it guarantees that the copy  will happen in linear time. It is also good for the scenario when we  want to reuse an array instead of allocating more memory in the  constructor of ArrayList.</p>
<p>One limitation of Collections.copy() is that it can accept only List  as source and destination parameters.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>171. What are the Java Collection  classes that implement List interface?</b></h1>
<p>Java classes that implement List interface are:</p>
<p>AbstractList  AbstractSequentialList  ArrayList  AttributeList</p>
<p>CopyOnWriteArrayList</p>
<p>LinkedList  RoleList</p>
<p>RoleUnresolvedList</p>
<p>Stack  Vector</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>172.What are the Java Collection  classes that implement Set interface?</b></h1>
<p>Java classes that implement Set interface are:</p>
<p>AbstractSet  ConcurrentSkipListSet  CopyOnWriteArraySet  EnumSet</p>
<p>HashSet</p>
<p>JobStateReasons  LinkedHashSet  TreeSet</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>173.What is the difference between an  Iterator and ListIterator in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Iterator and ListIterator are two interfaces in Java to traverse data  structures. The differences between these two are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ListIterator can be used to traverse only a List. But Iterator  can be used to traverse List, Set, and Queue etc.</li>
<li>An Iterator traverses the elements in one direction only. It  just goes. ListIterator can traverse the elements in two  directions i.e. backward as well as forward directions.</li>
<li>Iterator cannot provide us index of an element in the Data  Structure. ListIterator provides us methods like nextIndex()  and previousIndex() to get the index of an element during  traversal.</li>
<li>Iterator does not allow us to add an element to collection  while	traversing	it.	It	throws  ConcurrentModificationException. ListIterator allows use  to add an element at any point of time while traversing a  list.</li>
<li>An existing element’s value cannot be replaced by using  Iterator. ListIterator provides the method set(e) to replace  the value of last element returned by next() or previous()  methods.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>174.	What is the difference between  Iterator and Enumeration?</b></h1>
<p>Both Iterator and Enumeration are interfaces in Java to access Data  Structures. The main differences between these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enumeration is an older interface. Iterator is a newer  interface.</li>
<li>Enumeration can only traverse legacy collections. Iterator  can traverse both legacy as well as newer collections.</li>
<li>Enumeration does not provide remove() method. So we  cannot remove any element during traversal. Iterator  provides remove() method.</li>
</ul>
<p>4.	Iterator	is</p>
<p>a	fail-fast	interface,	it	gives</p>
<p>ConcurrentModificationException if any thread tries to  modify an element in the collection being iterated.  Enumeration is not fail-fast.</p>
<p>5.	Method	names	in	Iterator	are	shorter	than	in	an  Enumeration.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>175.What is the difference between an  ArrayList and a LinkedList data  structure?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between ArrayList and LinkedList data structures  are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Data Structure</b>:  An ArrayList is an indexed based  dynamic array. A LinkedList is a Doubly Linked List data  structure.</li>
<li><b>Insertion</b>: It is easier to insert new elements in a  LinkedList, since there is no need to resize an array.  Insertion in ArrayList is O(n), since it may require resizing  of array and copying its contents to new array.</li>
<li><b>Remove elements</b>: LinkedList has better performance in  removal of elements than ArrayList.</li>
<li><b>Memory Usage</b>: LinkedList uses more memory than  ArrayList, since it has to maintain links for next and  previous nodes as well.</li>
<li><b>Access</b>: LinkedList is slower in accessing an element,  since we have to traverse the list one by one to access the  right location.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>176.What is the difference between a  Set and a Map in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between a Set and a Map in Java are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Duplicate Elements</b>: A Set does not allow inserting  duplicate elements. A Map does not allow using duplicate  keys, but it allows inserting duplicate values for unique  keys.</li>
<li><b>Null values</b>: A Set allows inserting maximum one null  value. In a Map we can have single null key at most and  any number of null values.</li>
<li><b>Ordering</b>: A Set does not maintain any order of elements.  Some of sub-classes of a Set can sort the elements in an  order like LinkedHashSet. A Map does not maintain any  order of its elements. Some of its sub-classes like  TreeMap store elements of the map in ascending order of  keys.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>177.What is the use of a Dictionary  class?</b></h1>
<p>The Dictionary class in Java is used to store key-value pairs. Any  non-null object can be used for key or value. But we cannot insert a  null key or null object in Dictionary.</p>
<p>Dictionary class is deprecated now. So it should not be used in  newer implementations.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><<b>178.What is the default size of load  factor in a HashMap collection in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Default value of load factor in a HashMap is 0.75.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>179.What is the significance of load  factor in a HashMap in Java?</b></h1>
<p>A HashMap in Java has default initial capacity 16 and the load  factor is 0.75f (i.e. 75% of current map size). The load factor of a  HashMap is the level at which its capacity should be doubled.</p>
<p>For example, in a HashMap of capacity 16 and load factor .75. The  capacity will become 32 when the HashMap is 75% full. Therefore,  after storing the 12th key– value pair (16 * .75 = 12) into HashMap,  its capacity becomes 32.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>180.What are the major differences  between a HashSet and a HashMap?</b></h1>
<p>The main difference between a HashSet and a HashMap are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Base class</b>: A HashSet class implements the Set interface.  Whereas a HashMap class implements the Map interface.</li>
<li><b>Storage</b>: A HashSet is used to store distinct objects. A  HashMap is used for storing key &amp; value pairs, so that  these can be retrieved by key later on.</li>
<li><b>Duplicate Elements</b>: A HashSet does not allow storing  duplicate elements. A HashMap also does not allow  duplicate keys. But we can store duplicate values in a  HashMap.</li>
<li><b>Null Elements</b>: In a HashSet we can store a single null  value. In a HashMap we can store single null key, but any  number of null values.</li>
<li><b>Element Type</b>: A HashSet contains only values of objects  as its elements. Whereas a HashMap contains entries(key  value pairs).</li>
<li><b>Iteration</b>: By using an Iterator we can iterate a HashSet.  But a HashMap has to be converted into Set for iteration.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>181.What are the similarities between  a HashSet and a HashMap in Java?</b></h1>
<p>As the name suggests, HashSet and HashMap are Hashing based  collections. Similarities between HashSet and HashMap are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Thread Safety</b>: Both HashMap and HashSet are not  synchronized collections. Therefore they are not good for  thread-safe operations. To make these thread-safe we need  to explicitly use synchronized versions.</li>
<li><b>Order of Elements</b>: None of these classes guarantee the  order of elements. These are unordered collections.</li>
<li><b>Internal Implementation</b>: A HashMap backs up a HashSet  internally. So HashSet uses a HashMap for performing its  operations.</li>
<li><b>Performance</b>: Both of these collections provide constant  time performance for basic operations such as insertion  and removal of elements.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>182.	What is the reason for  overriding equals() method?</b></h1>
<h2>The equals() method in Object class is used to check whether two  objects are same or not. If we want a custom implementation we can  override this method.</h2>
<h2>For example, a Person class has first name, last name and age. If we  want two Person objects to be equal based on name and age, then  we can override equals() method to compare the first name, last  name and age of Person objects.</h2>
<h2>Generally in HashMap implementation, if we want to use an object  as key, then we override equals() method.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>183.How can we synchronize the  elements of a List, a Set or a Map?</b></h1>
<p>Sometimes we need to make collections Thread-safe for use in  Multi-threading environment. In Java, Collections class provides  useful static methods to make a List, Set or Map as synchronized  collections. Some of these methods are:</p>
<p>static	&lt;T&gt;	Collection&lt;T&gt; synchronizedCollection(Collection&lt;T&gt;  c)</p>
<p>Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) collection backed by the</p>
<p>specified collection.</p>
<p>static &lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt;	synchronizedList(List&lt;T&gt; list)</p>
<p>Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) list backed by the specified  list.</p>
<p>static &lt;K,V&gt; Map&lt;K,V&gt;synchronizedMap(Map&lt;K,V&gt; m)</p>
<p>Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) map backed by the specified  map.</p>
<p>static &lt;T&gt; Set&lt;T&gt;	synchronizedSet(Set&lt;T&gt; s)</p>
<p>Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) set backed by the specified  set.</p>
<p>static	&lt;K,V&gt;</p>
<p>SortedMap&lt;K,V&gt;	synchronizedSortedMap(SortedMap&lt;K,V&gt; m)  Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) sorted map backed by the  specified sorted map.</p>
<p>static &lt;T&gt; SortedSet&lt;T&gt; synchronizedSortedSet(SortedSet&lt;T&gt; s)  Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) sorted set backed by the  specified sorted set.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>184.	What is Hash Collision? How  Java handles hash-collision in  HashMap?</b></h1>
<p>In a Hashing scenario, at times two different objects may have same  HashCode but they may not be equal. Therefore, Java will face  issue while storing the two different objects with same HashCode in  a HashMap. This kind of situation is Hash Collision.</p>
<p>There are different techniques of resolving or avoiding Hash  Collision. But in HashMap, Java simply replaces the Object at old  Key with new Object in case of Hash Collision.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>185.	What are the Hash Collision  resolution techniques?</b></h1>
<p>To resolve a Hash Collision we can use one of the following  techniques:</p>
<p>Separate Chaining with Linked List  Separate Chaining with List Head Cells  Open Addressing with Coalesced Hashing  Open Addressing with Cuckoo Hashing  Hopscotch Hashing</p>
<p>Robinhood Hashing</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>186.What is the difference between  Queue and Stack data structures?</b></h1>
<h2>Queue is a FIFO data structure. FIFO stands for First In First Out. It  means the element added first will be removed first from the queue.  A real world example of Queue is a line for buying tickets at a  station. The person entering first in the Queue is served first.</h2>
<h2>Stack is a LIFO data structure. LIFO stands for Last In First Out.  The element that is added last is removed first from the collection.  In a Stack elements are added or removed from the top of stack.</h2>
<h2>A real world example of Stack is back button in browser. We can go  back one by one only and it works in the reverse order of adding  webpages to history	.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>187.What is an Iterator in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Iterator is an interface in Java to access the elements in a collection.  It is in java.util package.</p>
<p>It provides methods to iterate over a Collection class in Java.</p>
<p>Iterator interface in Java is based on Iterator design pattern. By  using an Iterator one can traverse a container of objects and can  also access the objects in the container. A container of objects is a  Collection class in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>188.	What is the difference between  Iterator and Enumeration in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between Iterator and Enumeration in Java are:</p>
<p>1.	<b>Version</b>: Enumeration interface is in Java since JDK 1.0.  Iterator interface was introduced in Java 1.2.</p>
<p>2.	<b>remove()	method</b>:</p>
<p>The	main	difference	between</p>
<p>Enumeration and Iterator interface is remove() method.  Enumeration can just traverse a Collection object. If we  use Enumeration, we cannot do any modifications to a  Collection while traversing the collection. Iterator  interface provides remove() method to remove an element  while traversing the Collection. There is not remove()  method in Enumeration interface.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Method names</b>: Names of methods in Iterator interface are  hasNext(), next(), remove(). Names of methods in  Enumeration interface are hasMoreElements(),  nextElement().</li>
<li><b>Legacy Interface</b>: Enumeration is considered as a legacy  interface. It is used to traverse legacy classes like Vector,  Stack and HashTable. Iterator is a newer interface that is  used to traverse almost all of the classes in Java  Collections framework.</li>
<li><b>Fail-fast vs. Fail-safe</b>: Iterator is based  on fail-fast  principle. It throws ConcurrentModificationException if a  collection is modified during iteration over that collection.  An Enumeration is based on fail-safe principle. It doesn’t  throw any exception if a collection is modified during  traversal.</li>
</ul>
<p>6. <b>Safety</b>: Since Iterator is fail-fast and does not allow  modification of a collection by other threads, it is  considered safer than Enumeration.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>189.	What is the design pattern  used in the implementation of  Enumeration in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Enumeration is based on Iterator design pattern. Iterator design  pattern provides a common interface with methods to traverse the  collection of objects. It hides the underlying implementation details  of the collection.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>190.Which methods do we need to  override to use an object as key in a  HashMap?</b></h1>
<p>If we want to use an object as a key in a HashMap in Java, then we  have to make sure that it has the implementation of equals() and  hashCode() methods.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>191.How will you reverse a List in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Collections class, Java provides a method reverse(List list) that  can be used to reverse a List.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>Collections.reverse(myList);</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>192.How will you convert an array of  String objects into a List?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides Arrays class in java.util package. Arrays class has a  method asList() that accepts an Array as input and returns a List as  output.</p>
<p>public static &lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt; asList(T... a)</p>
<p>String[] myArray = {&quot;George&quot; , &quot;Jack&quot; , &quot;Ryan&quot;};  List myList = Arrays.asList(myArray);</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>193.What is the difference between  peek(), poll() and remove() methods of  Queue interface in java?</b></h1>
<h2>In a Java Queue, poll() and remove() methods can be used for  removing the head object of Queue. The main difference arises in  the case when Queue is empty().</h2>
<h2>If Queue is empty then poll() method returns null value. If Queue is  empty then remove() method throws NoSuchElementException.</h2>
<h2>In a Java Queue, peek() method retrieves the head of Queue but it  does not remove it. If queue is empty then peek() method returns  null value.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>194.	What is the difference between  Array and ArrayList in Java?</b></h1>
<p>The main differences between Array and ArrayList in Java are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Size</b>: Array in Java is fixed in size. We cannot change the  size of array after creating it. ArrayList is dynamic in size.  When we add elements to an ArrayList, its capacity  increases automatically.</li>
<li><b>Performance</b>: In Java Array and ArrayList give different  performance for different operations.</li>
<li><b>add() or get(): </b>Adding an element to or retrieving an  element from an array or ArrayList object has similar  performance. These are constant time operations.</li>
<li><b>resize(): </b>Automatic resize of ArrayList slows down the  performance. ArrayList is internally backed by an Array.  In resize() a temporary array is used to copy elements from  old array to new array.</li>
<li><b>Primitives</b>: Array can contain both primitive data types as  well as objects. But ArrayList cannot contain primitive  data types. It contains only objects.</li>
<li><b>Iterator</b>: In an ArrayList we use an Iterator object to  traverse the elements.  We use for loop for iterating  elements in an array.</li>
<li><b>Type Safety</b>: Java helps in ensuring Type Safety of  elements in an ArrayList by using Generics. An Array can</li>
</ul>
<p>contain objects of same type of class. If we try to store a  different data type object in an Array then it throws  ArrayStoreException.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Length</b>: Size of ArrayList can be obtained by using size()  method. Every array object has length variable that is same  as the length/size of the array.</li>
<li><b>Adding elements</b>: In an ArrayList we can use add()  method to add objects. In an Array assignment operator is  used for adding elements.</li>
<li>Multi-dimension: An Array can be multi-dimensional. An  ArrayList is always of single dimension.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>195.How will you insert, delete and  retrieve elements from a HashMap  collection in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>We use following methods to insert, delete and retrieve elements in  a HashMap.</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Retrieve</b>: We use get() method to retrieve elements from a  HashMap.</li>
<h2>Value get(Object key)</h2>
<li><b>Insert</b>: We use put() method to insert a key value pair in a  HashMap.</li>
<h2>Value put(Key k, Value v)</h2>
<li><b>Delete</b>: We use remove() method to delete key-value pair  from the HashMap.</li>
<h2>Value remove(Object key)</h2>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>196.What are the main differences  between HashMap and  ConcurrentHashMap in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Synchronization</b>: A HashMap is not synchronized. But a  ConcurrentHashMap is a synchronized object.</li>
<li><b>Null Key</b>: A HashMap can have one null key and any  number of null values. A ConcurrentHashMap cannot have  null keys or null values.</li>
<li><b>Multi-threading</b>: A ConcurrentHashMap works well in a  multi-threading environment.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>197.What is the increasing order of  performance for following collection  classes in Java?</b></h1>
<p>The increasing order of performance is:</p>
<p>Hashtable  Collections.SynchronizedMap  ConcurrentHashMap  HashMap</p>
<p>Hashtable has the worst performance and HashMap has the best  performance.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>198.	Why does Map interface not  extend Collection interface in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>A Map is a collection objects. But Map interface is not compatible  with Collection interface in Java.</h2>
<h2>A Map requires key as well as a value. So it requires two  parameters to add an element to a HashMap.</h2>
<h2>But Collection interface provides add(Object o) method with only  one parameter.</h2>
<h2>Map collection has to provide methods like valueSet, keySet etc.  These methods are specific to Map collection. Where as methods in  Collection interface can be reused by a List, Set, Queue etc.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>199.What are the different ways to  iterate elements of a list in Java?</b></h1>
<p>There are mainly two ways to iterate the elements of list in Java:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Iterator</b>: We can get an Iterator for list and use it to iterate  the objects of the list.</li>
<li><b>For-each loop</b>: We can use for-each loop to traverse all  the elements of a list.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>200.	What is  CopyOnWriteArrayList?	How it is  different from ArrayList in Java?</b></h1>
<p>CopyOnWriteArrayList was introduced in Java 5 version. It is a  thread-safe collection. It is similar to an ArrayList.</p>
<p>In CopyOnWriteArrayList, all mutative operations (add, set etc.)  are implemented by making a fresh copy of the underlying array.</p>
<p>Iterator of CopyOnWriteArrayList is guaranteed to not throw  ConcurrentModificationException. But Iterator also does not reflect  any additions, removals that happened to list after the Iterator was  created.</p>
<p>All elements including null are permitted in CopyOnWriteArrayList.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>201.How remove() method is  implemented in a HashMap?</b></h1>
<p>Remove() method in HashMap uses logic similar to the one used in  get() method. First we locate the correct bucket in HashMap for an  entry. Then within that bucket we remove the element e. It is similar  to removing a node from a single-linked list.</p>
<p>If e is the first element in the bucket we set the corresponding  element of Hash to e.next. Else we set the next field of the element  just before e to e.next.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>202.	What is BlockingQueue in  Java Collections?</b></h1>
<p>BlockingQueue was introduced in Java 1.5. It extends Queue  interface in Java.</p>
<p>BlockingQueue supports operations that wait for  the queue to  become non-empty when retrieving an element. Also it supports the  operations that wait for space to become available in the queue  while storing an element.</p>
<p>Some of the features of BlockingQueue are:  It does not accept null elements.</p>
<p>Its main use is in producer-consumer problems.</p>
<p>BlockingQueue implementation is thread-safe.  It can be used in inter-thread communications.</p>
<p>It does not support any kind of &quot;close&quot; or &quot;shutdown&quot;</p>
<p>operation to indicate that no more items will be added.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>203.	How is TreeMap class  implemented in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Internally, a TreeMap class in Java uses Red-Black tree.</p>
<p>It is a NavigableMap. The map sorts the keys in natural order or it  can use a Comparator supplied at the creation time.</p>
<p>The implementation of TreeMap is not synchronized in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>204.	What is the difference between  Fail-fast and Fail-safe iterator in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Differences between Fail-fast  and Fail-safe iterators are as  follows:</p>
<p>Fail-fast iterator throws ConcurrentModificationException. But  Fail-safe iterator does not throw this exception.</p>
<p>Fail-fast iterator does not clone the original collection. Fail-safe  iterator creates a copy of the original collection of objects.</p>
<p>A Fail-fast iterator tries to immediately throw Exception when it  encounters failure. A Fail-safe  Iterator works on a copy of  collection instead of original collection.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>205.	How does  ConcurrentHashMap work in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>ConcurrentHashMap extends AbstractMap in Java. It was  introduced in Java 1.5. It provides concurrency in a collection  based on a HashMap.</h2>
<h2>All methods are thread-safe in ConcurrentHashMap.</h2>
<h2>Internally there is a Hashtable backing a ConcurrentHashMap. This  Hashtable supports the concurrent methods for retrieval of data as  well as updates on ConcurrentHashMap.</h2>
<h2>It has same functional specification as a Hashtable.</h2>
<h2>It also supports a set of sequential and bulk operations. These  operations accept parallelismThreshold argument.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>206.	What is the importance of  hashCode() and equals() methods?</b></h1>
<h2>In a HashMap collection it is very important for a key object to  implement hashCode() method and equals() method. If hashCode()  method returns same hashcode for all key objects then the hash  collision will be high in HashMap. Also with same hashcode, we  will get same equals method that will make our HashMap  inefficient.</h2>
<h2>The problem arises when HashMap treats both outputs same instead  of different. It will overwrite the most recent key-value pair with  the previous key-value pair.</h2>
<h2>So it is important to implement hashCode() and equals() methods  correctly for an efficient HashMap collection.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>207.	What is the contract of  hashCode() and equals() methods in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Contract of hashCode() and equals() methods is as follows in Java:</p>
<p>If object1.equals(object2), then object1.hashCode() ==  object2.hashCode() should always be true. It means if two objects  are equal then their hashCode should be same.</p>
<p>If object1.hashCode() == object2.hashCode() is true, it does not  guarantee that object1.equals(object2). It means if two objects have  same hashCode, then can still have different values so that may not  be equal objects.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>208.	What is an EnumSet in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Set: EnumSet is a specialized implementation of Set.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Use</b>: It is mainly used with enum types.</li>
<li><b>Single enum type</b>: All the elements in an EnumSet must  come from a single enum type when the set is created.</li>
<li><b>Bit vector</b>: Internally, EnumSet  is represented as bit  vector.</li>
<li><b>Iterator</b>: The iterator of EnumSet traverses the elements in  their natural order. (It is the order in which the enum  constants are declared).</li>
<li><b>Null</b>: In an EnumSet, null elements are not permitted. If we  try to insert a null element it throws NullPointerException.</li>
<li><b>Thread-safe</b>: EnumSet is not a synchronized collection.  For use in multi-threading scenarios, EnumSet should be  synchronized.</li>
<li><b>Bit flags</b>: EnumSet is a very good alternative to int based  “bit flags” implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>209.	What are the main Concurrent  Collection classes in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>Java 1.5 has provided new package java.util.concurrent. This  package contains thread-safe collection classed. These collection  classes can be modified while iterating. The iterator of these  classes is fail-safe.</h2>
<h2>Main Concurrent Collection classes in Java 8 are:</h2>
<h2>ArrayBlockingQueue  CopyOnWriteArrayList  CopyOnWriteArraySet  ConcurrentHashMap  ConcurrentLinkedDeque  ConcurrentLinkedQueue  LinkedBlockingQueue  LinkedBlockingDeque  PriorityBlockingQueue</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>210.How will you convert a Collection  to SynchronizedCollection in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides an easy method in java.utils.Collections class to  create a ThreadSafe collection from a regular collection.</p>
<p>We can use the method synchronizedCollection() for this purpose.  For any class of type T we can use following method:</p>
<p>static	&lt;T&gt;	Collection&lt;T&gt; synchronizedCollection(Collection&lt;T&gt;  c)</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>211.How IdentityHashMap is  different from a regular Map in Java?</b></h1>
<p>IndentityHashMap in Java implements Map interface. But it is not a  general purpose implementation. It violates the general contract of  Map interface by a different implementation of equals() method.</p>
<p>In an IdentityHashMap, two keys k1 and k2 are equal if and only if  (k1==k2). (In a normal Map implementation (like HashMap) two  keys k1 and k2 are considered equal if and only if (k1==null ?  k2==null : k1.equals(k2)).)</p>
<p>It implements the Map interface with a hash table, using reference-  equality in place of object-equality when comparing keys (and  values).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>212.What is the main use of  IdentityHashMap?</b></h1>
<p>Main uses of IdentityHashMap are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Topology Preservation: The typical use of  IdentityHashMap class is topology-preserving object  graph transformations, such as serialization or deep-  copying. In such a scenario, a program must maintain a  &quot;node table&quot; to keep track of all the object references that  have already been processed.</li>
<li>The node table should not considered distinct objects as  equal even if they happen to be equal.</li>
<li>Proxy objects: Another use of this class is to maintain  proxy objects. A debugging program has to maintain a  proxy object for each object in the program being  debugged.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>213.How can we improve the  performance of IdentityHashMap?</b></h1>
<p>IdentityHashMap class has one tuning parameter for performance  improvement: expectedMaxSize.</p>
<p>This parameter is the maximum number of key-value mappings that  the map is expected to hold.</p>
<p>We can use this parameter is used to determine the number of  buckets initially in the hash table. The precise relationship between  the expected maximum size and the number of buckets is  unspecified.</p>
<p>If the number of key-value mappings exceeds the expected maximum  size, the number of buckets is increased.</p>
<p>Increasing the number  of buckets is also known as rehashing.  Rehashing may be fairly expensive. So it is better to create identity  hash maps with a sufficiently large expected maximum size.</p>
<p>But iteration over a Map collection requires time proportional to  the number of buckets in the hash table. So iteration may take extra  time due to large number of buckets.</p>
<p>Therefore the value of expectedMaxSize should be set in  consideration with both of these aspects.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>214.	Is IdentityHashMap thread-  safe?</b></h1>
<p>The implementation of IdentityHashMap is not thread-safe, since its  methods are not synchronized.</p>
<p>The iterators returned by the iterator method of IdentityHashMap  are fail-fast. But the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be  guaranteed.</p>
<p>Since the Iterator is fail-fast, it throws  ConcurrentModificationException.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>215.What is a WeakHashMap in  Java?</b></h1>
<h2>WeakHashMap is a class similar to IdentityHashMap.</h2>
<h2>Internally, it is represented by a Hashtable.</h2>
<h2>It is not a synchronized class. We can make a WeakHashMap thread  safe by using Collections.synchronizedMap() method.</h2>
<h2>An entry in WeakHashMap is automatically removed when it is no  longer in ordinary use.</h2>
<h2>The presence of a mapping for a given key does not prevent the key  from being discarded by the garbage collector.</h2>
<h2>WeakHashMap also permits null keys and null values.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>216.How can you make a Collection  class read Only in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, there are useful methods to make a Collection class read  Only. We can make the Collection read Only by using one of the  following methods:</p>
<p>Collections.unmodifiableMap(Map m)  Collections.unmodifiableList(List l)  Collections.unmodifiableSet(Set s)  Collections.unmodifiableCollection(Collection c)</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>217.When is  UnsupportedOperationException  thrown in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In a Java collection UnsupportedOperationException is thrown  when the requested operation is not supported by the collection.</p>
<p>It is an unchecked exception that is thrown on optional operations.</p>
<p>If there is an optional add() or remove() methods in a read only  collection, then this exception can be thrown.</p>
<p><b>218.	Let say there is a Customer  class. We add objects of Customer  class to an ArrayList. How can we  sort the Customer objects in  ArrayList by using customer  firstName attribute of Customer  class?</b></p>
<p>There are two ways to handle this scenario. We can use these  options:</p>
<p>Comparable: Implement the Comparable interface for Customer</p>
<p>class and compare customer objects by firstName attribute.</p>
<p>Comparator: Implement Comparator for comparing two Customer  objects on the basis of firstName attribute. Then use this comparator  object in sort method of Collections class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>219.What is the difference between  Synchronized Collection and  Concurrent Collection?</b></h1>
<h2>In Java 1.5 many Concurrent collection classes were added in SDK.  These are ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList,  BlockingQueue etc.</h2>
<h2>Java also provides utility methods to get a synchronized copy of  collection like ArrayList, HashMap etc. by using  Collections.synchronizedList(), Collections.synchronizedMap()  methods.</h2>
<h2>The main difference is in performance. Concurrent  collection  classes have  better performance  than synchronized collection  classes because they lock only a portion of the class to achieve  concurrency and thread-safety.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>220.	What is the scenario to use  ConcurrentHashMap in Java?</b></h1>
<p>ConcurrentHashMap is more suited for scenarios where we have  multiple reader threads and one writer thread. In this case map is  locked only during the write operation.</p>
<p>If we have an equal number of reader and writer threads then  ConcurrentHashMap performance is similar to a Hashtable or a  synchronized HashMap.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>221.How will you create an empty  Map in Java?</b></h1>
<p>There are two ways to create an empty Map in Java.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Immutable</b>: If we want an immutable empty Map, we can  use following code:</li>
<p>myMap = Collections.emptyMap();</p>
<li><b>Any map</b>: For all other scenarios, we can use following  code by using new method:</li>
<p>myMap = new HashMap();</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>222.	What is the difference between  remove() method of Collection and  remove() method of Iterator?</b></h1>
<p>In Collection interface remove(Object o) method is used to remove  objects from a Collection.</p>
<p>List interface also provides remove(int index) method to remove an  object at a specific index.</p>
<p>These methods are used to remove an entry from Collection, while  no thread is iterating over it.</p>
<p>When we are iterating over a Collection, then we have to remove()  method of Iterator. This  method removes current element from  Iterator’s point of view. If we use remove(0 method of Collection  or List, then we will get ConcurrentModificationException.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is recommended to use remove() method of Iterator  during the traversal of a Collection by an Iterator.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>223.	Between an Array and  ArrayList, which one is the preferred  collection for storing objects?</b></h1>
<p>An ArrayList is backed up by array internally. There are many  usability advantages of using an ArrayList over an array in Java.</p>
<p>Array has a fixed length at the time of creation. Once it is created  we cannot change its length.</p>
<p>ArrayList is dynamic in size. Once it reaches a threshold, it  automatically allocates a new array and copies contents of old array  to new array.</p>
<p>Also ArrayList provides support of Generics. But Array does not  support Generics.</p>
<p>E.g. If we store an Integer object in a String array at Runtime it will  throw ArrayStoreException. Whereas, if we use ArrayList then as  compile time we will get the error. This helps in preventing errors  from happening at runtime.</p>
<p>If we know the size in advance and do not need re-sizing the  collection then Array should be used in place of an ArrayList.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>224.	Is it possible to replace  Hashtable with ConcurrentHashMap  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, a ConcurrentHashMap can be replaced with Hashtable in Java.</p>
<p>But it requires careful observation, since locking behavior of  Hashtable is different than that of ConcurrentHashmap.</p>
<p>A Hashtable locks whole Map instead of a portion of Map.  Compound operations like if(Hashtable.get(key) == null) put(key,  value) work in Hashtable but not in ConcurrentHashMap.</p>
<p>In a ConcurrentHashMap we use putIfAbsent() method for such a  scenario.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>225. How CopyOnWriteArrayList  class is different from ArrayList and  Vector classes?</b></h1>
<p>CopyOnWriteArrayList was introduced in Java 1.5. It implements  List interface.</p>
<p>It provides better concurrent access methods than a Synchronized  List.</p>
<p>In CopyOnWriteList, concurrency is achieved by copying ArrayList  over each write and replace with original instead of locking.</p>
<p>CopyOnWriteArrayList also does not throw any  ConcurrentModification Exception during Iteration.</p>
<p>It is a thread-safe list.</p>
<p>It is different from a Vector in terms of Concurrency.  CopyOnWriteArrayList provides better Concurrency by reducing  contention among readers and writers.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>226.	Why ListIterator has add()  method but Iterator does not have?</b></h1>
<h2>ListIterator can iterate in the both directions of a Collection. It  maintains two pointer for previous and next element. In ListIterator  we can use add() method to add an element into the list immediately  before the element returned by next() method.</h2>
<h2>So a subsequent call to next() method will not be affected. And the  call to previous() method will return the newly added element.</h2>
<h2>In Iterator we can only traverse in one direction. So there is no  purpose of add() method there.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>227.	Why do we sometime get</b></h1>
<p><b>ConcurrentModificationException  during iteration?</b></p>
<p>When we remove an object by using remove() method of a  Collection or List while an Iterator thread is traversing it, we get  ConcurrentModificationException. If an Iterator detects any  structural change in Collection it can throw  ConcurrentModificationException.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>228.	How will you convert a Map to  a List in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, a Map has three collection sets:</p>
<p>key set  value set</p>
<p>key-value set</p>
<p>Each of these Sets can be converted to List by using a constructor.  Sample code is as follows:</p>
<p>List keyList = new ArrayList(map.keySet());  List valueList = new ArrayList(map.values());  List entryList = new ArrayList(map.entrySet());</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>229.	How can we create a Map with  reverse view and lookup in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>In a Map we can lookup for a value by using a distinct key. In a Map  with reverse view and lookup, even the values are distinct. So there  is one to one mapping between keys and values and vice version.</h2>
<h2>If we enable this constraint on a Map then we can look up a key by  its value. Such data structure is called bi-directional map.</h2>
<h2>There is no built data structure similar to reverse lookup Map in  JDK.</h2>
<h2>But Apache Common Collections and Guava libraries provide  implementation of bidirectional map. It is called BidiMap and  BiMap. Both of these data structure enforce the constraint of one to  one mapping between keys and values.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>230.	How will you create a shallow  copy of a Map?</b></h1>
<h2>In Java, most implementations of Map interface provide a  constructor to create copy of another map. But the copy method is  not synchronized.</h2>
<h2>Therefore, when a thread is copying the map, another thread can  modify it.</h2>
<h2>To prevent such a scenario, we should use  Collections.synchronizedMap() method to first create a thread-safe  map.</h2>
<h2>Another way of to create a shallow copy is by using clone() method.  But it is not considered as a recommended approach.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>231.Why we cannot create a generic  array in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java does not allow creation of array with generics as elements.</p>
<p>In Java an array has to know the type information of its elements at  runtime.</p>
<p>This information is used at runtime to throw ArrayStoreException if  data type of an element to be inserted does not match the type of  Array.</p>
<p>In case of Generics, the type information of a collection is erased at  runtime by Type Erasure. Due to this array cannot use generics as  elements.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>232.	What is a PriorityQueue in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>A PriorityQueue is data structure based on Queue. Unlike Queue,  the elements on PriorityQueue are not returned in FIFO order.</p>
<p>A PriorityQueue maintains the natural order of its elements or it  uses a Comparator provided at initialization.</p>
<p>It is an unbounded queue based on a priority heap.</p>
<p>PriorityQueue does not allow null values. We cannot add any object  that does not provide natural ordering to PriorityQueue.</p>
<p>PriorityQueue in Java is not thread-safe.</p>
<p>It gives O(log n) time for enqueing and dequeing operations.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>233.	What are the important points  to remember while using Java  Collections Framework?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the important points to remember while using Java  Collections Framework are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Interfaces</b>: For Collections, we should write code with  generic interfaces instead of concrete implementation. Due  to this we maintain the flexibility of changing the  implementation at a later point of time.</li>
<li><b>Generics</b>: We should use Generics for type-safety and to  avoid ClassCastException at runtime.</li>
<li><b>Collections</b>: It is recommended to use Collections utility  class for algorithms and various other common methods  for Collections.</li>
<li><b>Right Type</b>: We have to choose the right type of Java  collection based on our need. If size is fixed, we can use  Array over ArrayList. If we do not want duplicate  elements we use Set.</li>
<p>If we need the ability to iterate the elements of a Map in  the order of insertion then we use a TreeMap.</p>
<li><b>Initial Size</b>: In some collection classes we can specify the  initial size/capacity. Therefore we should have an estimate  of number of elements in a Collection before deciding the  right collection type. We can use it to avoid rehashing or  resizing.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>234.	How can we pass a Collection  as an argument to a method and  ensure that method will not be able to  modify it?</b></h1>
<p>To ensure that a method is not able to modify a Collection passed as  an argument, we have to make the Collection read only.</p>
<p>We	can	make	a	read	only	collection	by	using  Collections.unmodifiableCollection(Collection c) method.</p>
<p>This will make sure that any operation to change the collection will  throw UnsupportedOperationException.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>235.	Can you explain how  HashMap works in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, a HashMap works on the concept of hashing.</p>
<p>A HashMap in Java stores both key and value objects, in a bucket. It  is stored as an Entry object that implements Map.Entry interface.</p>
<p>The key object used in a HashMap has to provide implementation  for hashCode() and equals() methods.</p>
<p>When put() method is used to store a key-value pair, the HashMap  implementation calls hashCode() method on Key object to calculate  a hash that is used to find a bucket where Entry object will be  stored.</p>
<p>When get() method is used to retrieve a value stored against a key  object, we first calculate a hash of Key object. Then we use this  hash to find the bucket in which that particular key is stored.</p>
<p>Once Key object’s location is found, it may happen that more than  one Key is stored in same location. So now we use equals() method  to find the exact Key object. Once the exact Key object is found we  use it to get Value object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>236.	Can you explain how HashSet  is implemented in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Internally, a HashSet uses a HashMap to store the elements and to  maintain the uniqueness of elements.</p>
<p>When we create a HashSet object, a corresponding HashMap object  is also created.</p>
<p>When	we	insert	an	element	in	HashSet,	it	inserts	it	into  corresponding HashMap.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>237.	What is a NavigableMap in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>As the name suggests, NavigableMap provides the capability to  navigate the keys of a Map in Java. A NavigableMap extends  SortedMap interface.</p>
<p>Some of the interesting methods of a NavigableMap are  descendingKeySet(), descendingMap(), headMap() and tailMap().</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>238.	What is the difference between  descendingKeySet() and  descendingMap() methods of  NavigableMap?</b></h1>
<p>The descendingKeySet() method of NavigableMap returns a  NavigableSet in which the elements are stored in reversed order as  compared to the original key set.</p>
<p>The returned view is internally represented by the original KeySet  of NavigableMap. Therefore any changes to the descending set also  get reflected in the original set.</p>
<p>But it is not recommended to remove elements directly from the key  set. We should use the Map.remove() method.</p>
<p>The descendingMap() method of NavigableMap returns a  NavigableMap which is an inverse view of the original Map. The  order of the elements in this view are in reverse order of the  elements in original map. Any changes to this view are also  reflected in the original map.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>239.	What is the advantage of  NavigableMap over Map?</b></h1>
<h2>The main advantage of NavigableMap over Map is the Navigation  capability.</h2>
<h2>It provides the capabilities of a Map, SortedMap and navigation in  one collection.</h2>
<h2>It even returns the closest matches for given search targets.</h2>
<h2>Methods like lowerEntry, floorEntry, ceilingEntry, and higherEntry  return Map.Entry objects associated with keys respectively less  than, less than or equal, greater than or equal, and greater than a  given key.</h2>
<h2>Methods like lowerKey, floorKey, ceilingKey, and higherKey return  only the associated keys. All of these methods are designed for  locating, not traversing entries.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>240.	What is the difference between  headMap(), tailMap() and subMap()  methods of NavigableMap?</b></h1>
<p>The headMap() method returns a view of the original  NavigableMap that contains the elements that are less than a given  element.</p>
<p>NavigableMap original = new TreeMap();  original.put(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;);</p>
<p>original.put(&quot;2&quot;, &quot;2&quot;);</p>
<p>original.put(&quot;3&quot;, &quot;3&quot;);</p>
<p>//this headmap1 will contain elements &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;  SortedMap headmap1 = original.headMap(&quot;3&quot;);</p>
<p>//this headmap2 will contain elements &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot; because  &quot;inclusive&quot;=true</p>
<p>NavigableMap headmap2 = original.headMap(&quot;3&quot;, true);</p>
<p>The tailMap() method works similar to headMap() method, but it  returns all elements that are higher than the given input element.</p>
<p>The subMap() method accepts two parameters demarcating the  boundaries of the view map to return.</p>
<p>All the three methods return a subset of the original map in a view  form.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>241.	How will you sort objects by  Natural order in a Java List?</b></h1>
<p>We can use Collections.sort method to sort the elements of a List in  natural order. To use this method, we have to make sure that element  objects implement compareTo() method.</p>
<p>We can also use a Comparator to define the natural ordering for  elements of a List. Then we can use this Custom Comparator in sort  method of Collections class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>242.	How can we get a Stream from  a List in Java?</b></h1>
<p>From Java 8 onwards it is a very easy to get a Stream from a List.  We can just use stream() method to get a stream from a list of  elements.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>243.	Can we get a Map from a  Stream in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>Yes, we can create a Map from the elements of a Stream. We can  use map() method to get a Map.</h2>
<h2>E.g. items.stream()</h2>
<h2>.map( item -&gt; item.toLowerCase() )</h2>
<h2>In this example we are creating a map with each item object  mapped to its LowerCase equivalent.</h2>
<h2>This is also used in Map-Reduce implementation on a Stream.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>244.	What are the popular  implementations of Deque in Java?</b></h1>
<p>The two most popular implementation of Deque interface in Java  are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ArrayDeque</b>: It is a resizable array implementation of  Deque. The capacity of ArrayDeque can increase based  on the need  of the program.  It is not thread safe  implementation. Also the iterator on ArrayDeque is fail-  fast.</li>
<li><b>LinkedList</b>: This is another popular implementation of  Deque interface in Java. It is also not synchronized, so it  is not thread-safe. It mainly provides functionality of a  doubly linked list.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Multi-threading</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>245.	What is a Thread in Java?</b></h1>
<p>A thread in Java is a lightweight process that runs within another  process or thread.</p>
<p>It is an independent path of execution in an application. JVM gives  each thread its own method-call stack.</p>
<p>When we start JVM,  Java  starts one thread.	This thread calls the  main method of the class passed in argument to java call.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>246.	What is the priority of a  Thread and how it is used in  scheduling?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, every Thread has a priority. This priority is specified as a  number between 1 to 10.</p>
<p>Scheduler in Java schedules different threads based on the priority  of a thread. It is also known as pre-emptive scheduling.</p>
<p>The thread with higher priority gets preference in execution over a  thread with lower priority.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>247.	What is the default priority of  a thread in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, a new thread gets the same priority as the priority of the  parent thread that creates it.</p>
<p>Default priority of a thread is 5 (NORM_PRIORITY).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>248.	What are the three different  priorities that can be set on a Thread  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>We can set following three priorities on a Thread object in Java:</p>
<ul>
<li>MIN_PRIORITY: This is the minimum priority that a  thread can have.</li>
<li>NORM_PRIORITY: This is the default priority that is  assigned to a thread.</li>
<li>MAX_PRIORITY: This is the maximum priority that a  thread can have.</li>
<p>Default priority of a thread is 5 NORM_PRIORITY. The value of  MIN_PRIORITY is 1 and the value of MAX_PRIORITY is 10.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>249.	What is the purpose of join()  method in Thread class?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, Thread Scheduler controls thread scheduling. But we can  use join() method on a thread to make current thread to wait for  another thread to finish.</p>
<p>When we use join(), the current thread stops executing. It wait for  the thread on which join() is called to finish.</p>
<p>This makes sure that current thread will continue only after the  thread it joined finished running. Consider following example:</p>
<p>Public class ThreadJoin {</p>
<p>Thread importantThread = new Thread(  new Runnable() {</p>
<p>public void run () {</p>
<p>//do something</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>);</p>
<p>Thread currentThread = new Thread(  new Runnable() {</p>
<p>public void run () {</p>
<p>//do something</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>);</p>
<p>importantThread.start(); // Line 1  importantThread.join(); // Line 2  currentThread.start(); // Line 3</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>In the above example, main thread is executing. On Line 1, a new  thread called importantThread is ready to run. But at Line 2, main</p>
<p>thread joins the importantThread. Now it lets importantTread to  finish and then it moves to Line 3. So currentThread at Line 3 will  not start till the importantThread has finished.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>250.	What is the fundamental  difference between wait() and sleep()  methods?</b></h1>
<p>The main difference between wait() and sleep() is that wait is an  Object level method, whereas sleep() is a static method in Thread  class. A waiting thread can be woken up by another thread by  calling notify() on the monitor which is being waited on. But a  sleeping thread cannot be woken up.</p>
<p>A wait() and notify() has to happen within the same block that is  synchronized on the monitor object.</p>
<p>When we call wait() the current thread releases the monitor and  goes to waiting state. Then another thread calls notify() to wake it  up.</p>
<p>In case of sleep() current thread does not release the monitor or  locks. It just sleeps for some pre-defined time period.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>251.Is it possible to call run() method  instead of start() on a thread in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. We can call run() method of a thread. But it does not work as a  separate thread. It will just work as a normal object in main thread  and there will not be context switching between the threads.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>252.	How Multi-threading works in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides support for Multithreading. In a Multithreading  environment, one process can execute multiple threads in parallel at  the same time.</p>
<p>In Java, you can create process and then create multiple threads  from that process. Each process can execute in parallel to perform  independent tasks.</p>
<p>Java provides methods like- start(), notify(), wait(), sleep() etc. to  maintain a multi-threading environment.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>253.	What are the advantages of  Multithreading?</b></h1>
<p>Main advantages of Multithreading are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance: We can improve performance of a  job by Multi-threading.</li>
<li>Simultaneous access to Multiple Applications: We can</li>
<p>access	multiple applications from a process by doing  multithreading</p>
</ul>
<p>3.	Reduced	number</p>
<p>of	Servers	required:	With	Multi-</p>
<p>threading we need lesser number of servers, since one  process can spawn multiple threads.</p>
<p>4.	Simplified Coding: In certain scenarios, it is easier to</p>
<p>code multiple threads than managing it from same thread.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>254.	What are the disadvantages of  Multithreading?</b></h1>
<p>There are certain downsides to Multithreading. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficult to Debug: Multithreading code is difficult to  debug in case of an issue.</li>
<li>Difficult to manage concurrency: Due to multiple threads,</li>
<p>we may experience different kinds of issues.</p>
<li>Difficulty of porting code: It is difficult to convert existing  single threaded code into multi-threading code.</li>
<li>Deadlocks: In case of multi-threading we can experience</li>
<p>deadlocks in threads that are waiting for same resource.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>255.	What is a Thread in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, a thread is a lightweight process that runs within another  process or thread. It is an independent path of execution in an  application. Each thread runs in a separate stack frame.</p>
<p>By default Java starts one thread when the main method of a class is  called.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>256.	What is a Thread’s priority  and how it is used in scheduling?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, every Thread has a priority. This priority is specified as an  integer value. The priority value is used in scheduling to pick up the  thread with higher priority for execution. The threads with higher  priority get more preference in execution than the threads with  lower priority.</p>
<p>The task scheduler schedules the higher priority threads first,  followed by the lower priority threads.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>257.	What are the differences  between Pre-emptive Scheduling  Scheduler and Time Slicing  Scheduler?</b></h1>
<p>In Pre-emptive scheduling, the highest priority task will keep getting  time to execute until it goes to waiting state or dead state or a task  with higher priority comes into queue for scheduling.</p>
<p>In Time slicing scheduling, every task gets a predefined slice of  time for execution, and then it goes to the pool of tasks ready for  execution. The scheduler picks up the next task for execution, based  on priority and various other factors.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>258.	Is it possible to call run()  method instead of start() on a thread  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. We can call run() method of a thread. But it does not work as a  separate thread. It will just work as a normal object in main thread  and there will not be context-switching between the threads.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>259.	How will you make a user  thread into daemon thread if it has  already started?</b></h1>
<p>No. We cannot make a user thread to daemon thread once it has  already started.</p>
<p>If	we	do	it	by	calling	setDaemon(),	it	will	throw  IllegalThreadStateException</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>260.	Can we start a thread two  times in Java?</b></h1>
<p>No. We can call start() method only once on a thread in Java. If we  call it twice, it will give us exception.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>261.In what scenarios can we  interrupt a thread?</b></h1>
<p>We can interrupt a thread if we want to wake it up from the sleep or  wait state.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>262.	In Java, is it possible to lock an  object for exclusive use by a thread?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. We can use synchronized block to lock an object. The locked  object is inaccessible to any other thread. Only the thread that has  locked it can access it.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>263.	How notify() method is  different from notifyAll() method?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, notify() method is used to unblock a specific thread that is  in waiting stated. Whereas, notifyAll() method is used to unblock  all the threads that are in waiting state.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>264.	What is a daemon thread in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>A daemon thread in Java is a low priority thread that does not  prevent the JVM from exiting when the program finishes. The thread  keeps running. Garbage Collection is an example of daemon thread.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>265.	How can we make a regular  thread Daemon thread in Java?</b></h1>
<p>We can call setDaemon(boolean) method to change a thread to  daemon thread before the thread starts.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>266.	How will you make a user  thread into daemon thread if it has  already started?</b></h1>
<p>No. We cannot make a user thread to daemon thread once it has  already started. If we do it by calling setDaemon(), it will throw  IllegalThreadStateException</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>267.	Can we start a thread two  times in Java?</b></h1>
<p>No. We can call start() method only once on a thread in Java. If we  call it twice, it will give us exception.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>268.	What is a Shutdown hook in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>The shutdown hook is a thread that is invoked implicitly by JVM  just before the shut down. It can be used to clean up unused  resources etc.</p>
<p>We can use java.lang.Runtime.addShutdownHook(Thread hook)  method to register a new virtual-machine shutdown hook.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>269.	What is synchronization in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>The concept of Synchronization in Java is used in Multi-threading  programming.</p>
<p>It is a feature in Java that helps in controlling the access of multiple  threads to a shared resource.</p>
<p>It is used to prevent Deadlock between multiple threads.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>270.	What is the purpose of  Synchronized block in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Synchronized	block	has	many	uses	in	Java	multi-threading  environment. Some of the uses are:</p>
<p>It can prevent thread interference</p>
<p>It is also used to avoid memory inconsistency issues</p>
<p>In general, scope of synchronized block is smaller than the scope of  a method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>271.What is static synchronization?</b></h1>
<p>We can make a static method as synchronized in Java. Adding  synchronized keyword to a static method can do this.</p>
<p>In static synchronization, the lock is on class not on object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>272.	What is a Deadlock situation?</b></h1>
<p>A Deadlock is a situation in which two or more threads are waiting  on each other to release a resource. Each thread is waiting for a  resource that is held by the other waiting thread.</p>
<p>At times there is a circular wait when more than two threads are  waiting on each other’s resources.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>273.	What is the meaning of  concurrency?</b></h1>
<p>Concurrency is the ability of a program to execute several programs  simultaneously. This is achieved by distributing computations over  multiple CPU cores of a machine or even over different machines  within the same network.</p>
<p>It can increase the speed of execution of the overall program in  multi-processor or multi-core system.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>274.	What is the main difference  between process and thread?</b></h1>
<p>As such both process and thread are independent sequences of  execution.</p>
<p>The main difference is that a thread runs in a shared memory space,  where as a process runs in its own memory space.</p>
<p>A process runs the execution in an environment provided by the  operating system. A process has its own set of private resources  (e.g. memory, open files, etc.).</p>
<p>A thread lives within a process and shares the resources like-  memory, open files etc. with the other threads of the same process.</p>
<p>This ability to share resources between different threads makes  thread more suitable for tasks where performance is a significant  factor.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>275.	What is a process and thread  in the context of Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, a process refers to the running of Java Virtual Machine  (JVM). But a thread lives within a JVM and it can be created or  stopped by the Java application at runtime.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>276.	What is a Scheduler?</b></h1>
<p>A scheduler is a program that is the implementation of a scheduling  algorithm to manage access of processes and threads to limited  resource like CPU or an I/O channel.</p>
<p>The goal of most scheduling algorithms is to provide load balancing  for the available processes/threads and to guarantee that each  process/thread will get a reasonable time frame to access the  requested resource exclusively.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>277.	What is the minimum number  of Threads in a Java program?</b></h1>
<p>In a JVM, each Java program is executed within the main process  that starts with java.exe. Therefore each Java application has at  least one thread.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>278.	What are the properties of a  Java thread?</b></h1>
<p>Each Java thread has following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Identifier</b>: An identifier of type long that is unique within  the JVM</li>
<li><b>Name</b>: A name of type String</li>
<li><b>Priority</b>: Priority of type int</li>
<li><b>State</b>: A state of type java.lang.Thread.State</li>
<li><b>Group</b>: A thread group the thread belongs to</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>279.	What are the different states of  a Thread in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Following are the different states of a Thread in Java:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>New</b>: In the New state the thread has not yet.</li>
<li><b>Runnable</b>: A thread executing in the JVM is in Runnable  state.</li>
<li><b>Blocked</b>: A thread waiting for  a monitor lock is in  Blocked state.</li>
<li><b>Waiting</b>: A thread waiting indefinitely for another thread  to perform a particular action is in Waiting state.</li>
<li><b>Timed_waiting</b>: A thread waiting for another thread to  perform an action for up to a specified waiting time is in  Timed_waiting state.</li>
<li><b>Terminated</b>: A thread that has exited is in Terminated  state.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>280.	How will you set the priority  of a thread in Java?</b></h1>
<p>The priority of a thread in Java can be set by using setPriority(int  priority) method.</p>
<p>We can use constant Thread.MAX_PRIORITY to set the maximum  priority of a thread.</p>
<p>We can use constant Thread.MIN_PRIORITY to set the minimum  priority of a thread.</p>
<p>Or we can use constant Thread.NORM_PRIORITY to set the default  priority of a thread.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>281.	What is the purpose of Thread  Groups in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, every thread belongs to a group of threads.</p>
<p>The JDK class java.lang.ThreadGroup provides methods to handle  a whole group of Threads.</p>
<p>With the help of these methods we can interrupt all threads of a  group or set the maximum priority of all threads of a group.</p>
<p>So a thread group is used for taking collective actions on a group of  threads.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>282.	Why we should not stop a  thread by calling its stop() method?</b></h1>
<p>The stop() method in Thread class is a deprecated method. Its use is  not recommended.</p>
<p>When we call stop() method, the thread unlocks all monitors that it  has acquired. If any locked object was in an inconsistent state, this  state gets visible to all other threads.</p>
<p>It can cause unexpected behavior when other threads work on this  inconsistent object.</p>
<p>So calling stop() method to stop a thread is not advisable.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>283.	How will you create a Thread  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>There are two main ways to create a thread in Java.</p>
<p>1. <b>Extend Thread class</b>: We can extend java.lang.Thread  class and implement run()  method. On calling start()  method it will start a new thread.</p>
<p>2.	<b>Implement	Runnable</b></p>
<p><b>interface</b>:	We	can	implement</p>
<p>java.lang.Runnable interface and pass the implemented  object to the constructor of java.lang.Thread class. On  calling start() it will start a new thread.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>284.	How can we stop a thread in  the middle of execution in Java?</b></h1>
<p>We can use a volatile variable as an indicator to stop the thread.</p>
<p>We can create a volatile reference pointing to the current thread.  This reference can be set to null by other threads to flag that the  current thread should stop execution.</p>
<p>In following example threadStopper is the volatile reference that  can be set as null in stopThread() method by other threads.</p>
<p>Sample code is as follows:</p>
<p>public static class MyThread extends Thread {  private volatile Thread threadStopper;  public void start() {</p>
<p>threadStopper = new Thread(this);  threadStopper.start();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public void stopThread() {  threadStopper = null;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public void run() {</p>
<p>Thread currThread = Thread.currentThread();  while(currThread == threadStopper) {</p>
<p>try {</p>
<p>Thread.sleep(100);</p>
<p>} catch (InterruptedException e) {</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>285.	How do you access the current  thread in a Java program?</b></h1>
<p>We can access the current thread in Java by calling the static method  currentThread() of java.lang.Thread class.</p>
<p>Sample code is as follows:  public class MyThread {</p>
<p>public static void main(String[] args) {</p>
<p>// Get ID of Current Thread</p>
<p>long id = Thread.currentThread().getId();</p>
<p>// Get Name of Current Thread</p>
<p>String name = Thread.currentThread().getName();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>286.	What is Busy waiting in Multi-  threading?</b></h1>
<p>Busy waiting is also known as busy-looping or spinning. It is a  multi-threading technique in which a process repeatedly checks if a  condition is true.</p>
<p>For example, a process can keep checking if any keyboard input is  available.</p>
<p>In general, busy waiting is considered as Anti-pattern that wastes  processor time, so it should be avoided.</p>
<p>Sample code for busy waiting is as follows:</p>
<p>Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {  @Override</p>
<p>public void run() {</p>
<p>long timeToStop = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000;  long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();</p>
<p>// Busy waiting</p>
<p>while (timeToStop &gt; currentTime) {  currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>});</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>287.	How can we prevent busy  waiting in Java?</b></h1>
<p>There is a simple way to prevent busy-waiting in Java. We can just  put the current thread to sleep for given amount of time.</p>
<p>It can be done by calling sleep() method of java.lang.Thread class.  We can pass the number of milliseconds to sleep() method as an  argument.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>288.	Can we use Thread.sleep()  method for real-time processing in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java does not guarantee that Thread.sleep() will cause the thread to  sleep for exactly N number of milliseconds. Sometime the thread  can sleep for than N number of milliseconds.</p>
<p>In real-time processing we need precise time period for which a  thread should run or sleep.</p>
<p>Therefore the invocation of Thread.sleep() method is not  recommended for use in real-time processing.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>289.	Can we wake up a thread that  has been put to sleep by using  Thread.sleep() method?</b></h1>
<p>We can use interrupt() method of java.lang.Thread class to interrupt  a thread that is in sleep state. It will get InterruptedException to  wake up from the sleep.</p>
<p>Sample code is as follows:</p>
<p>public class ThreadInterrupt implements Runnable {  public void run() {</p>
<p>try {</p>
<p>Thread.sleep(Long.MAX_VALUE);</p>
<p>} catch (InterruptedException e) {  SOP(“Interrupted by exception!&quot;);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Thread	myThread	=   new	Thread(new	ThreadInterrupt(),  “myThread&quot;);</p>
<p>myThread.start();</p>
<p>SOP(“Sleeping in main thread for 10 seconds”);</p>
<p>Thread.sleep(10000);  SOP(“Interrupting myThread&quot;);</p>
<p>myThread.interrupt();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>290.	What are the two ways to  check if a Thread has been  interrupted?</b></h1>
<p>These are the two ways to check for thread interruption:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Java, a Thread can call Thread.interrupted() method to  check if it has been interrupted or not.</li>
<li>The other option is to call isInterrupted() method of  Thread class to check if it has been interrupted or not.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>291.How can we make sure that  Parent thread waits for termination of  Child thread?</b></h1>
<p>We can use join() method for this purpose. On calling join() method,  current thread waits for the child thread to which it joins to finish.</p>
<p>Sample code is as follows:</p>
<p>Thread myThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {  public void run() {</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>});</p>
<p>myThread.start();</p>
<p>// Join on myThread  myThread.join();</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>292.	How will you handle  InterruptedException in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java we can get InterruptedException from sleep() or join()  methods. Throwing InterruptedException is way to inform that  another thread has interrupted this thread.</p>
<p>In general, the purpose of Interrupt is to ask current thread to stop its  current execution and finish unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Therefore ignoring this exception by catching it and only logging it  to the console or some log file is not the recommended approach.</p>
<p>The run() method of the Runnable interface does not allow that  throwing any exceptions. So we cannot re-throw  InterruptedException.</p>
<p>Therefore the correct way to handle this exception is that run()  method should check and handle this exception by itself and take  appropriate action.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>293.	Which intrinsic lock is  acquired by a synchronized method in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>When we mark a method as synchronized and then call this method,  then this method will first acquire the intrinsic lock of the object in  which that method is mentioned.</p>
<p>Once the synchronized method returns, it releases the lock.</p>
<p>In case the synchronized method throws an exception, the intrinsic  lock will be released.</p>
<p>Sample code equivalent to a synchronized method is:  public void myMethod() {</p>
<p>synchronized(this) {</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>294.	Can we mark a constructor as  synchronized in Java?</b></h1>
<p>No. We cannot mark a constructor as synchronized.</p>
<p>This will lead to compiler error.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this is that, in this case, only the constructing  thread would have access to the object being constructed.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>295.	Can we use primitive values  for intrinsic locks?</b></h1>
<p>No. Java does not allow primitive values to be used for intrinsic  locks.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>296.	Do we have re-entrant  property in intrinsic locks?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. An intrinsic lock can be accessed by the same thread multiple  times. So an Intrinsic lock is re-entrant.</p>
<p>If it is not allowed then the code that acquires a lock would have to  avoid acquiring the lock that it has already acquired.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>297.	What is an atomic operation?</b></h1>
<p>An atomic operation is an operation that completes in a single step  relative to other threads.</p>
<p>An Atomic operation is either executed completely or not at all.  There is no halfway mark in Atomic operation.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>298.	Can we consider the statement  i++ as an atomic operation in Java?</b></h1>
<p>No. The statement i++ is not an Atomic operation. It has more than  one operation.</p>
<p>First JVM loads the current value of i in memory. Then it  increments it. Finally it stores the new value back into variable i.</p>
<p>The current thread that executes this operation may be interrupted  between any of the above-mentioned three steps. Therefore it is not  an atomic operation.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>299.	What are the Atomic  operations in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java language provides some basic Atomic operations. These  operations can be used to make sure that concurrent threads always  see the same value.</p>
<p>Some of these Atomic operations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read operations on reference variables and primitive  variables (except long and double)</li>
<li>Write operations on reference variables and primitive  variables (except long and double)</li>
<li>Read operations on all variables declared as volatile</li>
<li>Write operations on all variables declared as volatile</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>300.	Can you check if following  code is thread-safe?</b></h1>
<p>public class SingletonDoubleCheck {</p>
<p>private SingletonDoubleCheck instance = null;</p>
<p>public SingletonDoubleCheck getInstance() {  if (instance == null) {</p>
<p>synchronized (SingletonDoubleCheck.class) {</p>
<p>if (instance == null) {</p>
<p>instance = new SingletonDoubleCheck();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>return instance;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>The above-mentioned code is for creating a Singleton class. But this  code is not thread-safe.</p>
<p>In this we check the value of instance  second time in the  synchronized block. But the JIT compiler can rearrange the  Bytecode in such a way that the reference to SingletonDoubleCheck  instance will be set before the execution of constructor.</p>
<p>Due to this the method getInstance() will return an object that may  not have been initialized properly.</p>
<p>We can use the keyword volatile for instance to make this thread-  safe code.</p>
<p>Any variables that is marked as volatile will be visible to other  threads only after the completion of the constructor of the object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>301.What are the minimum  requirements for a Deadlock situation  in a program?</b></h1>
<p>For a deadlock to occur following are the minimum requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mutual exclusion</b>: There has to be a resource that can be  accessed by only one thread at any point of time.</li>
<li><b>Resource holding</b>: One thread locks one resource and  holds it, and at the same time it tries to acquire lock on  another mutually exclusive resource.</li>
<li><b>No preemption</b>: There is no pre-emption mechanism by  which resource held by a thread can be freed after a  specific period of time.</li>
<li><b>Circular wait</b>: There can be a scenario in which two or  more threads lock one resource each and they wait for  each other’s resource to get free. This causes circular wait  among threads for same set of resources.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>302.	How can we prevent a  Deadlock?</b></h1>
<p>To prevent a Deadlock from occurring at least one requirement for a  deadlock has to be removed:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mutual exclusion</b>:  We can use optimistic locking to  prevent mutual exclusion among resources.</li>
<li><b>Resource holding</b>: A thread has to release all its exclusive  locks if it does not succeed in acquiring all exclusive locks  for resources required.</li>
<li><b>No preemption</b>: We can use timeout period for an  exclusive lock to get free after a given amount of time.</li>
<li><b>Circular wait</b>: We can check and ensure that circular wait  does not occur, when all exclusive locks have been  acquired by all the threads in the same sequence.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>303.	How can we detect a Deadlock  situation?</b></h1>
<p>We can use ThreadMXBean.findDeadlockedThreads() method to  detect deadlocks in Java program. This bean comes with JDK:</p>
<p>Sample code is as follows:</p>
<p>ThreadMXBean bean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();  long[] threadIds = bean.findDeadlockedThreads(); // It will return  null for no deadlock</p>
<p>if (threadIds != null) {</p>
<p>ThreadInfo[] infos = bean.getThreadInfo(threadIds);</p>
<p>for (ThreadInfo info : infos) {</p>
<p>StackTraceElement[] stack = info.getStackTrace();</p>
<p>// Log or store stack trace information.</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>304.	What is a Livelock?</b></h1>
<p>Livelock is a scenario in which two or more block each other by  responding to an action caused by another thread.</p>
<p>In a deadlock situation two or more threads wait in one specific  state.</p>
<p>In a Livelock scenario, two more threads change their state in such a  way that it prevents progress on their regular work.</p>
<p>E.g. Consider scenario in which two threads try to acquire two  locks. They release a lock that they have acquired, when they cannot  acquire the second lock.</p>
<p>In a Livelock situation, both threads concurrently try to acquire the  locks. Only one thread would succeed, the second thread may  succeed in acquiring the second lock.</p>
<p>Now both threads hold two different locks. And both threads want  to have both locks. So they release their lock and try again from the  beginning. This situation keeps repeating multiple times..</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>305.	What is Thread starvation?</b></h1>
<p>In a priority based scheduling, Threads with lower priority get  lesser time for execution than higher priority threads.</p>
<p>If a lower priority thread performs a long running computation, it  may happen that this thread does not get enough time to finish its  computations just in time. In such a scenario, the tread with lower  priority would starve. It will remain away from the threads with  higher priority.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>306.	How can a synchronized block  cause Thread starvation in Java?</b></h1>
<p>It is not defined for synchronization that which thread will enter a  synchronized block. It may happen that if many threads are waiting  for the entry to a synchronized block, some threads may have to wait  longer than other threads.</p>
<p>Hence these threads with lower priority will not get enough time to  finish their work in time.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>307.	What is a Race condition?</b></h1>
<p>A race condition is an unwanted situation in which a program  attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but  because of the logic of the program, the operations have to be  performed in proper sequence to run the program correctly.</p>
<p>Since it is an undesirable behavior, it is considered as a bug in  code.</p>
<p>Most of the time race condition occurs in “check then act” scenario.  Both threads check and act on same value. But one of the threads  acts in between check and act. See this example to understand race  condition.</p>
<p>if (x == 3) // Check</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>y = x * 5; // Act</p>
<p>// If another thread changes x</p>
<p>// between &quot;if (x == 3)” and &quot;y = x * 5”,</p>
<p>// then y will not be equal to 15.</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>308.	What is a Fair lock in multi-  threading?</b></h1>
<h2>In Java there is a class ReentrantLock that is used for implementing  Fair lock. This class accepts an optional parameter fairness. When  fairness is set to true, the RenentrantLock will give access to the  longest waiting thread.</h2>
<h2>The most popular use of Fair lock is in avoiding thread starvation.  Since longest waiting threads are always given priority in case of  contention, no thread can starve.</h2>
<h2>Downside of Fair lock is the low throughput of the program. Since  low priority or slow threads are getting locks multiple time, it leads  to slower execution of a program.</h2>
<h2>The only exception to a Fair lock is tryLock() method of  ReentrantLock. This method does not honor the value of fairness  parameter.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>309.	Which two methods of Object  class can be used to implement a  Producer Consumer scenario?</b></h1>
<h2>In a Producer Consumer scenario, one thread is a Producer and  another thread is a Consumer.</h2>
<h2>For this scenario to start working, a Consumer has to know when  the Producer has produced. In Object class, there is a wait()  method. A Consumer calls wait method to wait on Producer. The  Producer used notify() method of Object class to inform Consumer  that it has produced.</h2>
<h2>In this way the processor time between produce and consume  operations is freed due to the use of wait() and notify() methods.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>310.How JVM determines which  thread should wake up on notify()?</b></h1>
<p>If multiple threads are waiting on an object’s monitor, JVM  awakens one of them. As per Java specification the choice of this  thread is arbitrary and it is at the discretion of the implementation.  So there is no guarantee of rule that a specific thread will be  awakened by JVM on notify() method call.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>311. Check if following code is thread-  safe for retrieving an integer value  from a Queue?</b></h1>
<p>public class QueueCheck {  Queue queue;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public Integer getNextInt() {  Integer retVal = null;  synchronized (queue) {</p>
<p>try {</p>
<p>while (queue.isEmpty()) {  queue.wait();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>} catch (InterruptedException e) {  e.printStackTrace();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>synchronized (queue) {  retVal = queue.poll();  if (retVal == null) {</p>
<p>System.err.println(&quot;retVal is null&quot;);</p>
<p>throw new IllegalStateException();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>return retVal;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>In the above code Queue is used as object monitor to handle  concurrency issues. But it may not behave correctly in a multi-  threading scenario.</p>
<p>There are two separate synchronized blocks in above code. In case  two threads are woken up simultaneously by another thread, both</p>
<p>threads will enter one after in the second synchronized block.</p>
<p>Only one of the two threads will get new value from the queue and  make it empty. The second thread will poll on an empty queue and it  will not get any non-null return value.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>312.How can we check if a thread has  a monitor lock on a given object?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, Thread class has a static method holdsLock(Object  objToCheck) to check whether thread has a lock on objToLock  object.</p>
<p>This method will return true if current thread holds the lock on the  objToLock object that was passed as an argument to this method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>313.What is the use of yield() method  in Thread class?</b></h1>
<p>The yield() method of Thread class is used to give a hint to  scheduler that the current thread wants to free the processor.</p>
<p>The scheduler can either use this hint or just ignore this hint. Since  the scheduler behavior is not guaranteed, it may happen that the  current thread again gets the processor time.</p>
<p>It can be used for debugging or testing purposes. But there is rarely  any concrete use of this method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>314. What is an important point to  consider while passing an object from  one thread to another thread?</b></h1>
<p>This is a multi-threading scenario. In a multi-threading scenario, the  most important point is to check whether two threads can update  same object at the same time.</p>
<p>If it is possible for two threads to update the same object at the  same time, it can cause issues like race condition.</p>
<p>So it is recommended to make the object Immutable. This will help  in avoiding any concurrency issues on this object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>315.What are the rules for creating  Immutable Objects?</b></h1>
<p>As per Java specification, following are the rules for creating an  Immutable object:</p>
<p>Do not provide &quot;setter&quot; methods that modify fields or objects  referred to by fields.</p>
<p>Make all fields final and private.</p>
<p>Do not allow subclasses to override methods. The simplest way to  do this is to declare the class as final. A more sophisticated  approach is to make the constructor private and construct instances  in factory methods.</p>
<p>If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, do not  allow those objects to be changed.</p>
<p>Do not provide methods that modify the mutable objects.</p>
<p>Do not share references to the mutable objects. Never store  references to external, mutable objects passed to the constructor; if  necessary, create copies, and store references to the copies.  Similarly, create copies of your internal mutable objects when  necessary to avoid returning the originals in your methods.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>316.What is the use of ThreadLocal  class?</b></h1>
<h2>ThreadLocal class provides thread-local variables. Each thread  accesses only its own local variables. It has its own copy of the  variable.</h2>
<h2>By using ThreadLocal, if thread X stores a variable with value x  and another thread Y stores same variable with the value y, then X  gets x from its ThreadLocal instance  and Y gets y from its  ThreadLocal instance.</h2>
<h2>Typically, ThreadLocal instances are private static fields that are  associated with the state of a thread.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>317.What are the scenarios suitable  for using ThreadLocal class?</b></h1>
<p>We can use instance of ThreadLocal class to transport information  within an application.</p>
<p>One use case is to transport security or login information within an  instance of ThreadLocal so that every method can access it.</p>
<p>Another use case is to transport transaction information across an  application, without using the method-to-method communication.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>318.How will you improve the  performance of an application by  multi-threading?</b></h1>
<p>In an environment with more than one CPU, we can parallelize the  computation tasks on multiple CPUs. This leads to parallel  processing of a bigger task that takes lesser time due to multiple  threads dividing the work among themselves.</p>
<p>One example is that if we have to process 1000 data files and  calculate the sum of numbers in each file. If each file takes 5  minutes, then 1000 files will take 5000 minutes for processing.</p>
<p>But by using multi-threading we can process these files in 10  parallel threads. So each thread will take 100 files each. Since now  work is happening in 10 parallel threads, the time taken will be  around 500 minutes.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>319.What is scalability in a Software  program?</b></h1>
<p>Scalability is the capability of a program to handle growing amount  of work or its potential to be enlarged in order to accommodate  growth.</p>
<p>A program is considered scalable, if it is suitable to handle a large  amount of input data or a large number of users or a large number of  nodes.</p>
<p>When we say a program does not scale, it means that program fails  on increasing the size of task.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>320.	How will you calculate the  maximum speed up of an application  by using multiple processors?</b></h1>
<p>Amdahl’s law gives the theoretical speedup in latency of the  execution of a task at fixed workload.</p>
<p>It gives the formula to compute the theoretical maximum speed up  that can be achieved by providing multiple  processors to an  application.</p>
<p>If S is the theoretical speedup then the formula is:  S(n) = 1 / (B + (1-B)/n)</p>
<p>where n is the number of processors</p>
<p>B is the fraction of the program that cannot be executed in parallel.</p>
<p>When n converges against infinity, the term (1-B)/n converges  against zero. Therefore, the formula can be reduced in this special  case to 1/B.</p>
<p>In general, the theoretical maximum speedup behaves in inverse  proportion to the fraction that has to be executed serially. This  means the lower this fraction is, the more theoretical speedup can  be achieved.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>321.What is Lock contention in multi-  threading?</b></h1>
<p>Lock contention is the situation when one thread is waiting for a  lock/object that being held by another thread. The waiting thread  cannot use this object until the other thread releases the lock on that  object.</p>
<p>It is also known as Thread contention.</p>
<p>Ideally locks reduce the thread contention. Without locks, multiple  threads can operate on same object and cause undesirable behavior.  If locking is implemented correctly it reduces the occurrence of  contention between multiple threads.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>322.	What are the techniques to  reduce Lock contention?</b></h1>
<p>There are following main techniques to reduce Lock contention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the scope of lock.</li>
<li>Reduce object pooling.</li>
<li>Reduce the number of times a certain lock can be acquired.</li>
<li>Avoid synchronization at unnecessary places.</li>
<li>Implement hardware supported Optimistic locking in place  of synchronization.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>323.	What technique can be used in  following code to reduce Lock  contention?</b></h1>
<p>synchronized (map) {  Random r = new Random();</p>
<p>Integer value = Integer.valueOf(42);</p>
<p>String key = r.nextString(5);  map.put(key, value);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>The code uses Random() to get a random string and it also used  Integer to convert 42 in an object. Since these lines of code are  specific to this thread, these can be moved out of Synchronization  block.</p>
<p>Random r = new Random();</p>
<p>Integer value = Integer.valueOf(42);  String key = r.nextString(5);</p>
<p>synchronized (map) {  map.put(key, value);</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>324.	What is Lock splitting  technique?</b></h1>
<h2>Lock splitting is a technique to reduce Lock contention in multi-  threading. It is applicable in scenario when one lock is used to  synchronize access to different aspects of the same application.</h2>
<h2>Sometimes we put one lock to protect the whole array. There can be  multiple threads trying to get the lock for same array. This single  lock on array can cause Lock contention among threads. To resolve  this we can give one lock to each element of the array. Or we can  use modulus function to assign different locks to a small group of  array elements. In this way we can reduced the chance of Lock  contention. This is Lock splitting technique.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>325. Which technique is used in  ReadWriteLock class for reducing  Lock contention?</b></h1>
<h2>ReadWriteLock uses two locks. One lock for read-only operations,  another lock for write operations.</h2>
<h2>Its implementation is based on the premise that concurrent threads  do not need a lock when they want to read a value while no other  thread is trying to write.</h2>
<h2>In this implementation, read-only lock can be obtained by multiple  threads. And the implementation guarantees that all read operation  will see only the latest updated value as soon as the write lock is  released.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>326.	What is Lock striping?</b></h1>
<p>In Lock splitting we use different locks for different parts of the  application. In Lock striping we use multiple locks to protect  different parts of the same data structure.</p>
<p>ConcurrentHashMap class of Java internally uses different buckets  to store its values. Each bucket is chosen based on the value of key.  ConcurrentHashMap uses different locks to guard different buckets.  When one thread that tries to access a hash bucket, it can acquire the  lock for that bucket. While another thread can simultaneously  acquire lock for another bucket and access it. In a synchronized  version of HashMap, the whole map is has one lock.</p>
<p>Lock striping technique gives better performance than Synchronizing  the whole data structure.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>327.	What is a CAS operation?</b></h1>
<p>CAS is also known a Compare-And-Swap operation.</p>
<p>In a CAS operation, the processor provides a separate instruction  that can update the value of a register only if the provided value is  equal to the current value.</p>
<p>CAS operation can be used as an alternate to synchronization.</p>
<p>Let say thread T1 can update a value by passing its current value  and the new value to be updated to the CAS operation. In case  another thread T2 has updated the current value of previous thread,  the previous thread T1’s current value is not equal to the current  value of T2. Hence the update operation fails.</p>
<p>In this case, thread T1 will read the current value again and try to  update it.</p>
<p>This is an example of optimistic locking.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>328.	Which Java classes use CAS  operation?</b></h1>
<p>Java classes like AtomicInteger or AtomicBoolean internally use  CAS operations to support multi-threading.</p>
<p>These classes are in package java.util.concurrent.atomic.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>329.	Is it always possible to improve  performance by object pooling in a  multi-threading application?</b></h1>
<p>By using Object pools in an application we limit the number of new  objects to be created for a class. In a single thread operation, it can  improve the performance by reusing an already created object from  a pool.</p>
<p>In a multi-threading application an object pool has to provide  synchronized access to multiple threads. Due to this only one thread  can access the pool at a time. Also there is additional cost due to  Lock contention on pool. These additional costs can outweigh the  cost saved by reuse of an object from the pool.</p>
<p>Therefore using an Object pool may not always improve the  performance in a multi-threading application.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>330.	How can techniques used for  performance improvement in a single  thread application may degrade the  performance in a multi-threading  application?</b></h1>
<p>In a single thread applications we can use  Object pool for  performance optimization. Where as in multi-threading environment,  it may not be a good idea to use an Object pool. Increased overhead  of synchronization and lock contention can degrade the performance  gained by using Object pool in a multi-threading application.</p>
<p>Another example is the implementation in which a List keeps a  separate variable to hold the number of elements. This technique is  useful in single thread application where size() method can return  the value from this variable, without the need to count all the  elements of list.</p>
<p>But in a multi-threading application, this separate variable can  rather degrade the performance. This variable has to be access  controlled by a lock since multiple concurrent threads can insert an  element in a list. The additional cost of lock on this variable can  outweigh the benefit gained by it in a multi-threading application.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>331.What is the relation between  Executor and ExecutorService  interface?</b></h1>
<h2>Executor interface has only execute(Runnable) method. The  implementing class of this interface has to execute the given  Runnable instance passed to execute() method at some time in the  future.</h2>
<h2>ExecutorService interface extends Executor interface. It provides  additional methods like- invokeAny(), invokeAll(), shutdown(),  awaitTermination(). These method provide the ability to shutdown  the thread so that further requests can be rejected. Also it provides  ability to invoke a collection of Callable tasks.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>332.	What will happen on calling  submit() method of an  ExecutorService instance whose  queue is already full?</b></h1>
<p>The implementation of ExecutorService will throw  RejectedExecutionException, when its queue is already full and a  new task is submitted by calling submit() method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>333.	What is a  ScheduledExecutorService?</b></h1>
<p>ScheduledExecutorService interface extends the interface  ExecutorService. It provides various schedule() methods that can be  used to submit new tasks to be executed at a given point of time.</p>
<p>One of the schedule() method provides the ability to schedule a one-  shot task that can be executed after given delay.</p>
<p>Another version of schedule() method provides the ability to  execute ScheduleFuture after a given amount of delay.</p>
<p>In addition there are scheduleAtFixedRate() and  scheduleWithFixedDelay() methods that can execute an action at a  periodic interval of time.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>334.	How will you create a Thread  pool in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, Executors framework provides a method  newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads) that can be used to create a  Thread pool with a fixed number of threads.</p>
<p>Sample code is as follows:</p>
<p>public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException,  ExecutionException</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>ExecutorService myService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);  Future&lt;Integer&gt;[] futureList = new Future[5];</p>
<p>for (int i = 0; i &lt; futureList.length; i++) {</p>
<p>futureList[i] = myService.submit(new MyCallable());</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>for (int i = 0; i &lt; futureList.length; i++) {  Integer retVal = futureList[i].get();  println(retVal);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>myService.shutdown();</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>335.	What is the main difference  between Runnable and Callable  interface?</b></h1>
<p>Runnable interface defines run() method that does not return any  value.</p>
<p>Callable interface allows call() method to return a value to its  caller. A Callable interface can also throw an exception in case of  an error. Also Callable is a newer addition to Java since version  1.5.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>336.	What are the uses of Future  interface in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>We	can	use	Future	interface	to	represent	the	result	of	an  asynchronous computation.</h2>
<h2>These are the operations whose result is not immediately available.</h2>
<h2>Therefore Future interface provides isDone() method to check if the  asynchronous computation has finished or not.</h2>
<h2>We	can	also	check	if	the	task	was	cancelled	by	calling  isCancelled() method.</h2>
<h2>Future also provides cancel() method to attempt the cancellation of  a task.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>337. What is the difference in  concurrency in HashMap and in  Hashtable?</b></h1>
<p>In a Hashtable class all methods are synchronized.</p>
<p>In a HashMap implementation all the methods are not synchronized.</p>
<p>Therefore Hashtable is a thread-safe collection. HashMap is not a  thread-safe collection.</p>
<p>In a multi-threading it is not advisable to use regular HashMap. We  can use ConcurrentHashMap class in multi-threading applications.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>338.	How will you create  synchronized instance of List or Map  Collection?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, Collections class provides methods to synchronize any  collection.</p>
<p>It also provides synchronizedList(List) and synchronizedMap(Map)  methods that can be used to convert a List or Map to a synchronized  instance.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>339.	What is a Semaphore in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Semaphore class in Java is used to implement a counting  semaphore. It is used to restrict the number of threads that can  access a physical or logical resource.</p>
<p>A Semaphore maintains a set of permits that should be acquired by  competing threads.</p>
<p>We can also use it to control how many threads can access the  critical section of a program or a resource concurrently.</p>
<p>The first argument in Semaphore constructor is the total number of  permits available. Each invocation of acquire() method tries to  obtain one of the available permits.</p>
<p>The acquire() method is used to acquire a permit from the  semaphore. If we pass number of permits required to acquire()  method, then it blocks the thread until that number of permits are  available.</p>
<p>Once a thread has finished its work, we can use release() method to  release the permits.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>340.	What is a CountDownLatch in  Java?</b></h1>
<h2>CountDownLatch class helps in implementing synchronization in  Java. It is used to implement the scenarios in which one or more  threads have to wait until other threads have reached the same state  such that all thread can start.</h2>
<h2>There is a synchronized counter that is decremented until it reaches  the value zero. Once it reaches zero, it means that all waiting  threads can proceed now.</h2>
<h2>It is a versatile tool that can be used for other Synchronization  scenarios as well. It can also work as on/off latch or gate. All  threads invoking await() method wait at the gate until it is opened  by a thread invoking countdown() method.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>341.	What is the difference between  CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier?</b></h1>
<p>CyclicBarrier takes an optional Runnable task that is run once the  common barrier condition is achieved.</p>
<p>CountDownLatch is used in simple use cases where a simple start  stop is required. A CyclicBarrier is useful in complex scenarios  where more coordination is required. E.g. MapReduce algorithm  implementation.</p>
<p>CyclicBarrier resets the internal value to the initial value once the  value reaches zero. CyclicBarrier can be used to implement the  scenarios in which threads have to wait for each other multiple  times.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>342.	What are the scenarios suitable  for using Fork/Join framework?</b></h1>
<p>ForkJoinPool class is in the center of Fork/Join framework. It is a  thread pool that can execute instances of ForkJoinTask.</p>
<p>ForkJoinTask class provides the fork() and join() methods. The  fork() method is used to start the asynchronous execution of a task.  The join() method is used to await the result of the computation.</p>
<p>Therefore, divide-and-conquer algorithms can be easily  implemented with Fork/Join framework.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>343.	What is the difference between  RecursiveTask and RecursiveAction  class?</b></h1>
<h2>RecursiveAction class has compute() method that does not have to  return a value.</h2>
<h2>RecursiveAction can be used when the action has to directly  operate on a Data structure. It does not need to return any computed  value.</h2>
<h2>In RecursiveTask class has compute() method that always returns a  value.</h2>
<h2>Both RecursiveTask and RecursiveAction classes are used in  ForkJoinTask implementations.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>344. In Java 8, can we process  stream operations with a Thread  pool?</b></h1>
<p>In Java 8, Collections provide parallelStream() method to create a  stream that can be processed by a Thread pool.</p>
<p>We can also call the intermediate method parallel() on a given  stream to convert it into a sequential stream of parallel tasks.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>345.	What are the scenarios to use  parallel stream	in Java 8?</b></h1>
<h2>A parallel stream in Java 8 has a much higher overhead compared  to a sequential one.</h2>
<h2>It takes a significant amount of time to coordinate the threads.  We can use parallel stream in following scenarios:</h2>
<h2>When there are a large number of items to process and the  processing of each item takes time and is parallelizable.</h2>
<h2>When there is a performance problem in the sequential processing.</h2>
<h2>When current implementation is not already running in a multi-  thread environment. If there is already a multi-threading  environment, adding parallel stream can degrade the performance.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>346.	How Stack and Heap work in  Java multi-threading environment?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, Stack and heap are memory areas available to an  application. Every thread has its own stack. It is used to store local  variables, method parameters and call stack.</p>
<p>Local variables stored in Stack of one Thread are not visible to  another Thread.</p>
<p>Where as, Heap is a common memory area in JVM. Heap is shared  by all threads. All objects are created inside heap.</p>
<p>To improve performance thread can cache the values from heap into  their stack. This can create problem if the same variable is modified  by more than one thread.</p>
<p>In such a scenario we should used volatile keyword to mark a  variable volatile. For a volatile variable the thread always reads  the value from main memory.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>347.	How can we take Thread dump  in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>The steps to take Thread dump of Java process depends on the  operating system.</h2>
<h2>On taking Thread dump, Java writes the state of all threads in log  files or standard error console.</h2>
<h2>We can press Ctrl + Break key together to take thread dump in  Windows.</h2>
<h2>We can execute kill -3 command for taking Thread dump on Linux.</h2>
<h2>Another option to take Thread dump is jstack tool. We can pass  process id of java process to this tool for taking Thread dump.</h2>
<h2>This is the simple one, -Xss parameter is used to control stack size  of Thread in Java. You can see this list of JVM options to learn  more about this parameter.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>348.	Which parameter can be used  to control stack size of a thread in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>We use –Xss parameter to control the stack size of a thread in Java.</p>
<p>If we set it as 1 MB, then every thread will get 1MB of stack size.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>349.	There are two threads T1 and  T2? How will you ensure that these  threads run in sequence T1, T2 in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java there are multiple ways to execute threads in a sequence.</p>
<p>One of the simplest way for sequencing is join() method of Thread  class.</p>
<p>We can call join() method to start a thread when another thread has  finished.</p>
<p>We start with the last thread to execute first. And make this thread  join on the next thread.</p>
<p>In this case we start thread T2 first. And then call T1.join() so that  thread T2 waits for thread T1 to finish execution.</p>
<p>Once T1 completes execution, T2 thread starts executing.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Java 8</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>350.	What are the new features  released in Java 8?</b></h1>

<li>Faster execution with Nashorn JavaScript engine support</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>352.	What is a Lambda expression  in Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>Lambda expression is an anonymous function. It is like a method  that does not need any access modifiers, name or return value  declaration. It accepts a set of input parameters and returns result.</p>
<p>Lambda expression can be passed as a parameter in a method. So  we can treat code in Lambda expression as data. This piece of code  can be passed to other objects and methods.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>353.	What are the three main parts  of a Lambda expression in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Three main parts of a Lambda expression are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parameter list: A Lambda expression can have zero or  more parameters. Parameter list is optional to Lambda.</li>
<li>Lambda arrow operator: “-&gt;” is known as Lambda arrow  operator. It separates the list of parameters and the body of  Lambda.</li>
<li>Lambda expression body: The piece of code that we want  to execute is written in Lambda expression body.</li>
<p>E.g. In following example:</p>
<p>Arrays.asList( &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot; ).forEach( e -&gt; System.out.println( e ) );  Parameter list = e</p>
<p>Arrow = -&gt;</p>
<p>Body = System.out.println( e )</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>354.	What is the data type of a  Lambda expression?</b></h1>
<p>A Lambda expression fulfills the purpose of passing code as data.</p>
<p>The data type of a Lambda expression is a Functional interface.  In most of the cases this is java.lang.Runnable interface.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>355.	What is the meaning of  following lambda expression?</b></h1>
<p>( e -&gt; System.out.println( e ) );</p>
<p>This Lambda expression takes a parameter e and prints it via  System.out.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>356.	Why did Oracle release a new  version of Java like Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>The main theme of Java 8 is support for functional programming.  With increase in Database size and growth of multi-code CPU  servers, there is need for Java to support such large-scale systems.</p>
<p>With new features of Java 8, it is possible to create functional  programs to interact efficiently with Big Data systems. Support for  Streams is very helpful in this regard.</p>
<p>Lambda expressions are very useful for cloud computing where we  can pass code as data and run the same code on multiple servers.</p>
<p>Optional is a best practice that is borrowed from Google Guava  library for handling the exceptional cases. This has made programs  more robust with support for edge cases.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>357.	What are the advantages of a  lambda expression?</b></h1>
<p>We can pass a lambda expression as an object to a method. This  reduces the overhead involved in passing an anonymous class.</p>
<p>We can also pass a method as a parameter to another method using  lambda expressions.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>358.	What is a Functional interface  in Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>A Functional interface in Java is an interface that has exactly one  abstract method.</p>
<p>It can have default methods with implementation. A default method  is not abstract.</p>
<p>In Java 8, java.lang.Runnable and java.util.concurrent.Callable are  two very popular Functional interfaces.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>359.	What is a Single Abstract  Method (SAM) interface in Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>A Functional interface is also known as Single Abstract Method  Interface, since it has exactly one abstract method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>360.	How can we define a  Functional interface in Java 8?</b></h1>
<h2>To define a Functional interface in Java 8, we can create an  Interface with exactly one abstract method.</h2>
<h2>Another way is to mark an Interface with annotation  @FunctionalInterface. Even with the annotation we have to follow  the rule of exactly one abstract method.</h2>
<h2>The only exception to this rule is that if we override  java.lang.Object class’s method as an abstract method, then it does  not count as an abstract method.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>361.Why do we need Functional  interface in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Functional Interfaces are mainly used in Lambda expressions,  Method reference and constructor references.</p>
<p>In functional programming, code can be treated as data. For this  purpose Lambda expressions are introduced. They can be used to  pass a block of code to another method or object.</p>
<p>Functional Interface serves as a data type for Lambda expressions.  Since a Functional interface contains only one abstract method, the  implementation of that method becomes the code that gets passed as  an argument to another method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>362.	Is it mandatory to use  @FunctionalInterface annotation to  define a Functional interface in Java  8?</b></h1>
<p>No, it is not mandatory to mark a Functional interface with  @FunctionalInterface annotation.</p>
<p>Java does not impose this rule.</p>
<p>But, if we mark an interface with @FunctionalInterface annotation  then Java Compiler will give us error in case we define more than  one abstract method inside that interface.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>363.	What are the differences  between Collection and Stream API in  Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between Collection and Stream API in Java 8 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version: Collection API is in use since Java 1.2. Stream  API is recent addition to Java in version 8.</li>
<li>Usage: Collection API is used for storing data in different</li>
<p>kinds of data structures. Stream API is used for   computation of data on a large set of Objects.</p>
<li>Finite: With Collection API we can store a finite number</li>
<p>of elements in a data structure. With Stream API, we can  handle streams of data that can contain infinite number of  elements.</p>
<li>Eager vs. Lazy: Collection API constructs objects in an</li>
<p>eager manner. Stream API creates objects in a lazy manner.</p>
<li>Multiple consumption: Most of the Collection APIs  support iteration and consumption of elements multiple  times. With Stream API we can consume or iterate  elements only once.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>364.	What are the main uses of  Stream API in Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>Main uses of Stream API in Java 8 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It helps in using data in a declarative way. We can make  use of Database functions like Max, Min etc., without  running a full iteration.</li>
<li>It makes good  use of multi-core architectures without</li>
<p>worrying about multi-threading code.</p>
<li>We can create a pipeline of data operations with Java  Stream that can run in a sequence or in parallel.</li>
<li>It provides support for group by, order by etc. operations.</li>
<li>It supports writing for code in Functional programming  style.</li>
<li>It provides parallel processing of data.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>365.	What are the differences  between Intermediate and Terminal  Operations in Java 8 Streams?</b></h1>
<p>Main	differences	between	Intermediate	and	Terminal	Stream  operations are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation: Intermediate operations are not evaluated until  we chain it with a Terminal Operation of Stream. Terminal  Operations can be independently evaluated.</li>
<li>Output:  The  output  of Intermediate  Operations  is another</li>
<p>Stream. The output of Terminal Operations is not a Stream.</p>
<li>Lazy: Intermediate Operations are evaluated in lazy  manner. Terminal Operations are evaluated in eager  manner.</li>
<li>Chaining: We can chain multiple Intermediate Operations</li>
<p>in  a	Stream.	Terminal	Operations	cannot   be	chained  multiple times.</p>
<li>Multiple: There can be multiple Intermediate operations in</li>
<p>a Stream operation. There can be only one Terminal  operation in Stream processing statement.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>366.	What is a Spliterator in Java  8?</b></h1>
<p>A Spliterator is a special type of Iterator to traverse and partition  the elements of a source in Java. A source can be a collection, an IO  channel or a generator function.</p>
<p>A Spliterator may traverse elements individually or sequentially in  bulk.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>367.	What are the differences  between Iterator and Spliterator in  Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between Iterator and Spliterator are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spliterator can be used with Streams in Java 8. Where as,  Iterator is just used with Collection.</li>
<li>Spliterator	uses	Internal	Iteration	to	iterate	Streams.</li>
<p>Iterator uses External Iteration to iterate Collections.</p>
<li>Spliterator can iterate Streams in Parallel as well as  Sequential manner. Iterator only iterates in Sequential  manner.</li>
<li>Spliterator can traverse elements individually as well as in</li>
<p>bulk. Iterator only iterates elements individually.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>368.	What is Type Inference in Java  8?</b></h1>
<p>A Java compiler can see each method’s invocation and it  declaration to determine what are type arguments required for  invocation.</p>
<p>By Type Inference, Java can determine the types of the arguments as  well as the type of the result being returned.</p>
<p>Type inference algorithm also tries to find the most specific type  that can work with all types of arguments.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>369.	Does Java 7 support Type  Inference?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, Java 7 supports Type Inference. In Java 8, Oracle has enhanced  the Type Inference concept. Now it can be used to define Lambda  expressions, functions and Method references.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>370.	How does Internal Iteration  work in Java 8?</b></h1>
<h2>In an Iterator, the fundamental question is that which party controls  the iteration. Is it Iterator or the Collection on which iterator runs.</h2>
<h2>When a Collection controls the iterator, then it is called External  Iteration. When the Iterator controls the iteration then it is called  Internal Iteration.</h2>
<h2>In case of Internal Iteration, the client hands over an operation to  Iterator and the Iterator applies the operation to all the elements in  aggregate.</h2>
<h2>Internal Iteration is easier to implement, since the Iterator does not  have to store the state of the collection.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>371.What are the main differences  between Internal and External  Iterator?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between Internal and External Iterator are as  follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Internal Iterator controls the iteration itself. In an  External Iterator collection controls the iteration.</li>
<li>Internal Iterator can iterate elements in individually as</li>
<p>well as in</p>
<li>Bulk (like forEach). External iterator iterates element one  by one.</li>
<li>Internal Iterator does not have to iterate elements only</li>
<p>sequentially. External Iterator always iterates sequentially.</p>
<li>Internal Iterator supports declarative programming style  that goes  well with functional programming. External  Iterator follows imperative style OOPS programming.</li>
<li>Some people consider Internal Iterator code more readable</li>
<p>than that of External Iterator.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>372.	What are the main advantages  of Internal Iterator over External  Iterator in Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the main advantages of Internal Iterator are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal Iterator is based  on Functional programming,  therefore it can work on declarative style code.</li>
<li>There is no need to sequentially iterate elements in Internal</li>
<p>Iterator.</p>
<li>Code is more readable and concise in Internal Iterator.</li>
<li>Internal	Iterator	supports	concurrency	and	parallel  processing.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>373.	What are the applications in  which we should use Internal  Iteration?</b></h1>
<p>We need Internal Iterator in applications that require high  performance, parallel processing, fast iteration and bulk operations  support.</p>
<p>Also in Internal Iteration applications, we do not have much control  over iteration. The other features like parallel processing etc.  become more important.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>374.	What is the main disadvantage  of Internal Iteration over External  Iteration?</b></h1>
<p>Internal Iteration has many advantages over External Iteration. But it  has one big disadvantage. Since Java API is responsible for  iterating in Internal iterator, developer does not get any control over  iteration.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>375.	Can we provide  implementation of a method in a Java  Interface?</b></h1>
<p>Before Java 8, it was not allowed to provide implementation of a  method in an Interface.</p>
<p>Java 8 has introduced the flexibility of providing implementation of  a method in an interface. There are two options for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default Method: We can give default implementation of a  method.</li>
<li>Static Method: We can create a static method in an</li>
<p>interface and provide implementation.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>376.	What is a Default Method in  an Interface?</b></h1>
<p>In Java 8, we can provide implementation of a method in an  Interface and mark this method with Default keyword.</p>
<p>In this way, this implementation of the method becomes default  behavior for any class implementing the interface.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>377.	Why do we need Default  method in a Java 8 Interface?</b></h1>
<h2>Default methods in an Interface provide backward compatibility  feature in Java 8.</h2>
<h2>Let say there is an interface Car that is implemented by BMW,  Chevrolet and Toyota classes. Now a Car needs to add capability  for flying. It will require change in Car interface. Some of the car  classes that do not have flying capability may fail. Therefore a  Default Implementation of flying methods is added in Car interface  so that cars with no flying capability can continue to implement the  original Car interface.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>378.	What is the purpose of a Static  method in an Interface in Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>A Static method in an Interface is utility or helper method. This is  not an object level instance method. Some of the uses of Static  method in an Interface are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single Class: There is no need to create a separate Utils  class for storing utility or helper methods. We can keep  these methods in same interface.</li>
<li>Encapsulation: With Static methods, complete behavior of</li>
<p>a Class is encapsulated in same class. There is no need to  maintain multiple classes.</p>
<li>Extension: It is easier to extend a Class/API. If we extend</li>
<p>a collection ArrayList, we get all the methods. We need not  extend Collections class also.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>379.	What are the core ideas behind  the Date/Time API of Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>There are three core ideas behind the Date/Time API of Java 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immutable-value classes: The new API avoids thread-  safety and concurrency issues by ensuring that all the core  classes are immutable and represent well-defined values.</li>
<li>Domain-driven design: The new API is modeled on  precise domain with classes that represent different use  cases for Date and Time.</li>
<li>The emphasis on domain-driven design offers benefits like  clarity and understandability.</li>
<li>Separation of chronologies: The new API allows people to  work with different calendar systems. It supports the needs  of users in different areas of the world likes Japan or  Thailand that don’t follow ISO-8601.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>380.	What are the advantages of  new Date and Time API in Java 8 over  old Date API?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the advantages of Java 8 Date Time API over existing Date  API are:</p>
<p>Concurrency: Existing Date Time classes (such as java.util.Date and  SimpleDateFormatter) are not thread-safe. This does not work well  in concurrent applications. In new Date Time API, developer does  not have to deal with concurrency issues while writing date-  handling code.</p>
<p>Better Design: Date/Time classes prior to Java 8 have poor API  design. For example, years in java.util.Date start at 1900, months  start at 1, and days start at 0. It is not very intuitive. Java 8 Date  Time API handles it very well.</p>
<p>No need for 3rd Party Libraries: With the popularity of third-party  Date/Time libraries like Joda Time, Java has to make its native  Date/Time API comparable. Now we can use the Java API instead  of using 3rd party libraries.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>381.What are the main differences  between legacy Date/Time API in Java  and Date/Time API of Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>Main   difference	between   legacy   Date/Time	API	and	Java	8  Date/Time API are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Old API is not Thread safe. Java 8 API is Thread safe.</li>
<li>Old API has many mutable objects. New Java 8 API is  based on Immutable objects.</li>
<li>Performance	of	old	API	is	not	good.	New	Java	8</li>
<p>Date/Time API gives better performance.</p>
<li>Old API is less readable and maintainable. New Java 8  API is very well designed and is more readable.</li>
<li>Old API has month values from 0 to 11. New API has</li>
<p>months from 1 to 12.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>382.	How can we get duration  between two dates or time in Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>In Java8, we have a new class Duration that provides the utility of  computing duration between two dates.</p>
<p>We can call the static method Duration.between(date1, date2) to get  the time period in hours, mins, days etc. between date1 and date2.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>383. What is the new method family  introduced in Java 8 for processing of  Arrays on multi core machines?</b></h1>
<p>Java 8 has enhanced the Arrays class with methods that can run  efficiently on multi core machines.</p>
<p>These methods start with keyword parallel.</p>
<p>Egg. Arrays.parallelSetAll(), Arrays.parallelSort() etc.</p>
<p>This parallel set of methods provides parallel processing of Arrays  that can run Java code very fast on a multi core machine.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>384. How does Java 8 solve  Diamond problem of Multiple  Inheritance?</b></h1>
<p>In Multiple Inheritance if a class extends more than one classes with  two different implementation of same method then it causes  Diamond problem.</p>
<p>Consider following example to see problem and solution for  Diamond problem in Java 8:</p>
<p>public interface BaseInterface{</p>
<p>default void display() { //code goes here }</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public interface BaseOne extends BaseInterface { }  public interface BaseTwo extends BaseInterface { }</p>
<p>public class ChildClass implements BaseOne, BaseTwo { }</p>
<p>In the above code, class ChildClass gives compile time error. Java  Compiler cannot decide which display method should it invoke in  ChildClass.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, Java SE 8 has given the following remedy:  public interface A{</p>
<p>default void display() { //code goes here }</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public interface B extends A{ }  public interface C extends A{ }  public class D implements B,C{  default void display() {</p>
<p>B.super.display();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public interface BaseInterface{</p>
<p>default void display() { //code goes here }</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public interface BaseOne extends BaseInterface { }  public interface BaseTwo extends BaseInterface { }  public class ChildClass implements BaseOne, BaseTwo {  default void display(){</p>
<p>BaseOne.super.display();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>The	method   invocation  at   BaseOne.super.display();   solves	the  Diamond problem as it resolves the confusion for compiler.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>385. What are the differences  between Predicate, Supplier and  Consumer in Java 8?</b></h1>
<h2>The subtle difference between Predicate, Supplier and Consumer in  Java 8 is as follows:</h2>
<h2>Predicate is an anonymous function that accepts one argument and  returns a result.</h2>
<h2>Supplier is an anonymous function that accepts no argument and  returns a result.</h2>
<h2>Consumer is an anonymous function that accepts one argument and  returns no result.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>386.	Is it possible to have default  method definition in an interface  without marking it with default  keyword?</b></h1>
<p>No, we have to always mark a default method in interface with  default keyword.</p>
<p>If we create a method with implementation in an interface, but do  not mark it as default, then we will get compile time error.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>387.	Can we create a class that  implements two Interfaces with  default methods of same name and  signature?</b></h1>
<p>No, it is not allowed to create a class that implements interfaces  with same name default methods.</p>
<p>It will give us compile time error for duplicate default methods.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>388.	How Java 8 supports Multiple</b></h1>
<p><b>Inheritance?</b></p>
<p>In Multiple Inheritance a class can inherit behavior from more than  one parent classes.</p>
<p>Prior  to  Java 8,	a class can implement multiple interfaces but</p>
<p>extend only one class.</p>
<p>In Java 8, we can have method implementation within an interface.  So an interface behaves like an Abstract class.</p>
<p>Now if we implement more than one interface with method  implementation in a class, it means we are inheriting behavior from  multiple abstract classes. That is how we get Multiple Inheritance  in Java 8.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>389.	In case we create a class that  extends a base class and implements  an interface. If both base class and  interface have a default method with  same name and arguments, then  which definition will be picked by  JVM?</b></h1>
<p>In such a scenario, JVM will pick the definition in base class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>390.	If we create same method and  define it in a class , in its parent class  and in an interface implemented by  the class, then definition will be  invoked if we access it using the  reference of Interface and the object  of class?</b></h1>
<p>In all the cases, method defined in the class will be invoked.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>391.Can we access a static method of  an interface by using reference of the  interface?</b></h1>
<p>No, a static method of interface has to be invoked by using the name  of the interface.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>392.	How can you get the name of  Parameter in Java by using  reflection?</b></h1>
<p>Java 8 has introduced a method Parameter.getName() to get the  name of a parameter by using reflection.</p>
<p>Before using this feature, we need to turn on this feature in Java  compiler.</p>
<p>To turn on this feature, just run javac with –parameters argument.</p>
<p>To verify the availability of this feature, we can use Parameter.  isNamePresent() method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>393.	What is Optional in Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>Optional is a container object that may have a null or non-null  value. If it has a value then isPresent() method returns true.</p>
<p>It a value is present, we can call get() method to get the value. Else  we will get nothing.</p>
<p>It is very useful in handling data that has null values.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>394.	What are the uses of Optional?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the uses of Optional in Java are:</p>
<p>We	can	use	Optional	to	avoid	NullPointerException	in	an  application.</p>
<p>Optional performs Null check at compile time, so we do not get run</p>
<p>time exception for a null value.</p>
<p>Optional reduces the codebase pollution by removing unnecessary  null checks.</p>
<p>Optional can also be used to handle default case for data when a</p>
<p>value is null.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>395.	Which method in Optional  provides the fallback mechanism in  case of null value?</b></h1>
<p>In case, an Optional has null value, we can use orElseGet() method  as fallback mechanism. If we implement orElseGet() method, it will  be invoked when the value of Optional is null.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>396.	How can we get current time  by using Date/Time API of Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>In Java 8 we can use Clock class to get the current time. Instead of  using old method System.currentTimeMillis(),  we can create a  Clock object and call millis() method to get the current time in  milliseconds.</p>
<p>We can also call instant() method on Clock object to get the current  time in a readable format.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>397.	Is it possible to define a static  method in an Interface?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, from Java 8, an Interface can also has a static method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>398.	How can we analyze the  dependencies in Java classes and  packages?</b></h1>
<p>Java 8 comes with a new command line tool jdeps that can help in  analyzing the package-level and class-level dependencies.</p>
<p>We can pass a jar file name or a class name as an argument to this  tool. It will list all the dependencies of that jar or class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>399.	What are the new JVM  arguments introduced by Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>In Java 8, PermGen space of ClassLoader is removed. It has been  replaced with MetaSpace.</p>
<p>Now we can set the initial and maximum size of MetaSpace.</p>
<p>The JVM options -XX:PermSize and –XX:MaxPermSize are  replaced by -XX:MetaSpaceSize and -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize  respectively in Java 8.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>400.	What are the popular  annotations introduced in Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the popular annotations introduced in Java 8 are:</p>
<p>@FunctionalInterface: This annotation is used to mark an interface  as Functional Interface. As mentioned earlier, A FunctionalInterface  can be used for lambda expressions.</p>
<p>@Repeatable: This annotation is used for marking another  annotation. It indicates that the marked annotation can be applied  multiple times on a type.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>401.	What is a StringJoiner in Java  8?</b></h1>
<p>StringJoiner is a new class in Java 8 that can be used to create a  String. It can construct a sequence of characters separated by a  delimiter. It can also optionally add a prefix and suffix to this  sequence. We can use this sequence to get a String.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>The String &quot;[One:Two:Three]&quot; may be constructed as follows:</p>
<p>StringJoiner sj = new StringJoiner(&quot;:&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;);</p>
<p>sj.add(&quot;One&quot;).add(&quot;Two&quot;).add(&quot;Three&quot;);  String desiredString = sj.toString();</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>402.	What is the type of a Lambda  expression in Java 8?</b></h1>
<p>The type of a lambda expression depends on the context it is being  used.</p>
<p>A lambda is like a method reference. It does not have a type of its  own.</p>
<p>Generally, a Lambda is an instance of a Functional Interface.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>403.	What is the target type of a  lambda expression ?</b></h1>
<p>The target type of a lambda expression represents a type to which  the expression can be converted.</p>
<p>The target type for a lambda expression is a functional interface.</p>
<p>The lambda expression must have same parameter type as the  parameter in the function of the interface. It must also return a type  compatible with the return type of function.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>404.	What are the main differences  between an interface with default  method and an abstract class in Java  8?</b></h1>
<p>An interface with a default method appears same as an Abstract  class in Java. But there are subtle differences between two.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instance	variable:	An	interface	cannot	have	instance  variables. An abstract class can have instance variables.</li>
<li>Constructor: An interface cannot have a constructor. An</li>
<p>abstract class can have constructor.</p>
<li>Concrete Method: An interface cannot have  concrete  methods other than default method. An abstract class is  allowed to define concrete methods with implementation.</li>
<li>Lambda: An interface with exactly one default method can</li>
<p>be used for lambda expression. An abstract class cannot be  used for lambda expression.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Java Tricky Questions</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>405.	Is there any difference between  a = a + b and a += b expressions?</b></h1>
<p>When we add two integral variables e.g. variables of type byte,  short, or int in Java, then they are first promoted to int type, and then  addition happens.</p>
<p>The += operator implicitly casts the result of addition into the type  of variable used to hold the result.</p>
<p>What happens when you put return statement or System.exit () on try</p>
<p>or catch block? Will finally block execute?</p>
<p>It is a popular tricky Java interview question. Most of the  programmers think that no matter what the finally block will always  execute. This question challenges that concept by putting a return  statement in the try or catch block or calling System.exit() from try  or catch block.</p>
<p>You can answer by saying that finally block executes even if we put  a return statement in the try block or catch block. But finally block  does not execute if you call System.exit() from try or catch block.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>406.	What does the expression 1.0 /</b></h1>
<p><b>0.0 return? Will there be any  compilation error?</b></p>
<p>Double class is the source of many tricky interview questions. You  may know about the double primitive type and Double class. But  while doing floating point arithmetic some people don't pay enough  attention to Double.INFINITY, NaN, and -0.0. There are rules that  govern the floating point arithmetic calculations involving Double.</p>
<p>The answer to this question is that 1.0 / 0.0 will compile  successfully. And it will not throw ArithmeticException. It will just  return Double.INFINITY.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>407.	Can we use multiple main  methods in multiple classes?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. When we start an application in Java, we just mention the class  name to be run to java command. The JVM looks for the main  method only in the class whose name is passed to java command.  Therefore, there is no conflict amongst the multiple classes having  main method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>408.	Does Java allow you to  override a private or static method?</b></h1>
<p>The question is tricky but the answer is very simple. You cannot  override a private or static method in Java. If we create a similar  method with same return type and same method arguments in child  class, then it will hide the superclass method. This is known as  method hiding.</p>
<p>Also, you cannot override a private method in sub class because  Private method is not visible even in a subclass. Therefore, what  you can do is to create another private method with the same name  in the child class.</p>
<p>So in both the cases, it is not method overriding. It is either method  hiding or a new method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>409.	What happens when you put a  key object in a HashMap that is  already present?</b></h1>
<p>In a HashMap there are buckets in which objects are stored. Key  objects with same HashCode go to same bucket.</p>
<p>If you put the same key again in a HashMap, then it will replace the  old mapping because HashMap doesn't allow duplicate keys. The  same key will have same HashCode as previous key object. Due to  same HashCode, it will be stored at the same position in the bucket.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>410.	How can you make sure that N  threads can access N resources  without deadlock?</b></h1>
<h2>This question checks your knowledge of writing multi-threading  code. If you have experience with deadlock and race conditions,  you can easily answer this.</h2>
<h2>The answer is that by resource ordering you can prevent deadlock.  If in our program we always acquire resources in a particular order  and release resources in the reverse order, then we can prevent the  deadlock.</h2>
<h2>So a thread waiting for same resource can not get into deadlock  while the other thread is trying to get it and holding the resource  required by first thread. If both of them release the resources in right  order, one of them can acquire it to finish the work.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>411.How can you determine if JVM is  32-bit or 64-bit from Java Program?</b></h1>
<p>We can find JVM bit size 32 bit or 64 bit by running java command  from the command prompt.</p>
<p>Or we can get it from Java program.</p>
<p>Sun has a Java System property to determine the bit size of the  JVM: 32 or 64:</p>
<p>sun.arch.data.model=32 // 32 bit JVM  sun.arch.data.model=64 // 64 bit JVM</p>
<p>We can use System.getProperty(&quot;sun.arch.data.model&quot;) to determine  if it is 32/64 bit from Java program.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>412. What is the right data type to  represent Money (like Dollar/Pound)  in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>To represent money you need decimal points in the numbers like</h2>
<h2>$1.99.</h2>
<h2>BigDecimal class provides good methods to represent Money.  Using BigDecimal, we can do the calculation with decimal points  and correct rounding. But using BigDecimal is a little bit high on  memory usage.</h2>
<h2>We can also use double with predefined precision. But calculation  on double can give erroneous results.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>413.	How can you do multiple  inheritances in Java?</b></h1>
<p>This is a question to trick people coming from C++ and Scala  background to Java. There are many Object Oriented languages that  support multiple inheritances. But Java is not one of them.</p>
<p>Answer of this question can be that, Java does support multiple  inheritances of by allowing an interface to extend other interfaces.  You can implement more than one interface. But you cannot extend  multiple classes. So Java doesn't support multiple inheritances of  implementation.</p>
<p>But in Java 8, the default method breaks the rule of multiple  inheritances behavior.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>414.	Is ++ operation thread-safe in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>No, ++ operator is not a thread safe operation. It involves multiple  instructions like- reading a value, incrementing it and storing it back  into memory. These instructions  can overlap between multiple  threads. So it can cause issues in multi-threading.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>415.	How can you access a non-  static variable from the static context?</b></h1>
<h2>We cannot access a non-static variable from the static context in  Java. If you write a code like that, then you will get compile time  error. It is one of the most common problems for beginner Java  programmers, when they try to access instance variable inside the  main method in a class.</h2>
<h2>Since main method is static in Java, and instance variables are non-  static, we cannot access instance variable inside main. The solution  is to create an instance of the object and then access the instance  variables.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>416.	Let say there is a method that  throws NullPointerException in the  superclass. Can we override it with a  method that throws  RuntimeException?</b></h1>
<p>This question is checking your understanding of the concepts of  method overloading and overriding in Java.</p>
<p>We can throw superclass of RuntimeException in an overridden  method, but we cannot do the same if it is a checked Exception.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>417.	How can you mark an array  volatile in Java?</b></h1>
<p>If you know multi-threading well then you can easily answer it.</p>
<p>We can mark an array volatile in Java. But it makes only the  reference to array volatile, not the whole array.</p>
<p>If one thread changes the reference variable to point to another  array, then it will provide a volatile guarantee. But if multiple  threads are changing individual array elements, they won't be having  same reference due to the reference itself being volatile.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>418.	What is a thread local variable  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Thread-local variable is a variable restricted to a specific thread. It  is like thread's own copy of variable that is not shared among  multiple threads.</p>
<p>Java provides ThreadLocal class to support thread-local variables.</p>
<p>To achieve thread-safety, you can use it. To avoid any memory leak,  it is always good to remove a thread-local variable, once its work  is done.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>419.	What is the difference between  sleep() and wait() methods in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, we use these methods to pause currently running thread.  There is a simple difference between these.</p>
<p>sleep() is actually meant for short pause because it doesn't release  lock.</p>
<p>wait() is meant for conditional wait and it can release a lock that  can be acquired by another thread to change the condition on which  it is waiting.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>420.	Can you create an Immutable  object that contains a mutable object?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, it is possible to create an Immutable object that contains a  mutable object.</p>
<p>We should not share the reference of the mutable object, since it is  inside an immutable object. Instead, we can return a copy of it to  other methods.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>421.	How can you convert an Array  of bytes to String?</b></h1>
<p>You can convert an Array of bytes to String object by using the  String constructor that accepts byte[]. We need to make sure that  right character encoding is used. Else we may get different results  after conversion.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>422.	What is difference between  CyclicBarrier and CountDownLatch  class?</b></h1>
<p>CyclicBarrier and CountDownLatch classes were introduced from  Java 5.</p>
<p>We can reuse CyclicBarrier even if it is broken, but we cannot reuse  CountDownLatch in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>423.	What is the difference between  StringBuffer and StringBuilder?</b></h1>
<p>StringBuilder was introduced in Java 5. The main difference  between both of them is that StringBuffer methods e.g. length(),  capacity(), append() are synchronized. But corresponding methods  in StringBuilder are not synchronized.</p>
<p>Due to this difference, concatenation of String using StringBuilder is  faster than StringBuffer. Now it is considered bad practice to use  StringBuffer, because, in most of the scenarios, we perform string  concatenation in the same thread.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>424.	Which class contains clone  method? Cloneable or Object class?</b></h1>
<p>It is a very basic trick question. clone() method is defined in Object  class. Cloneable is a marker interface that doesn't contain any  method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>425.	How will you take thread dump  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>There are platform specific commands to take thread dump in Java.</p>
<p>In Linux/Unix, just use kill -3 PID, where PID is the process id of  Java process. It will give the thread dump of Java process.</p>
<p>In Windows, press Ctrl + Break. This will instruct JVM to print  thread dump in standard out or err. It can also go to console or log  file depending upon your application configuration.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>426.	Can you cast an int variable  into a byte variable? What happens if  the value of int is larger than byte?</b></h1>
<p>An int is 32 bit in Java. But a byte is just 8 bit in Java. We can cast  an int to byte. But we will lose higher 24 bits of int while casting.  Because a byte can hold only first 8 bits of int. Remaining 24 bits  (32-8 = 24) will be lost.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>427.	In Java, can we store a double  value in a long variable without  explicit casting?</b></h1>
<p>No, we cannot store a double value into a long variable without  casting it to long. The range of double is more than that of long. So  we need to type cast.</p>
<p>To answer this question, just remember which one is bigger  between double and long in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>428.	What will this return 5*0.1 ==  0.5? true or false?</b></h1>
<p>The answer is false because floating point numbers can not be  represented exactly in Java, so 5*0.1 is not same as 0.5.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>429.	Out of an int and Integer,  which one takes more memory?</b></h1>
<p>An Integer object takes more memory than an int in Java. An Integer  is an object and it stores meta-data overhead about the object. An  int is a primitive type so its takes less memory and there is no meta-  data overhead.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>430.	Can we use String in the switch  case statement in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. From Java 7 onwards, String can be used in switch case  statement. This gives convenience to programmer. But internally  hash code of String is used for the switch statement.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>431.	Can we use multiple main  methods in same class?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. You can have multiple methods with name main in the same  class. But there should be only one main method with the signature  public static void main(String[] args). JVM looks for main with this  signature only. Other methods with name main in same class are just  ignored.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>432.	When creating an abstract  class, is it a good idea to call abstract  methods inside its constructor?</b></h1>
<p>No, we should avoid calling abstract methods in the constructor of  an abstract class. Because, it can restrict how these abstract  methods can be implemented by child classes.</p>
<p>Many IDE give “Overridable method call in constructor” warning  for such implementation.</p>
<p>This is a problem of object initialization order. The superclass  constructor will run before the child class constructor. It means  child class is not yet initialized. But due to presence of overridden  method in superclass, the overridden method of subclass is called  when the subclass is not fully initialized.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>433.	How can you do constructor  chaining in Java?</b></h1>
<p>When we call one constructor from another constructor of the same  class, then it is known as constructor chaining in Java. When you  have multiple overloaded constructors in a class, you can do  constructor chaining.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>434.	How can we find the memory  usage of JVM from Java code?</b></h1>
<h2>We can use memory management related methods provided in  java.lang.Runtime class to get the free memory, total memory and  maximum heap memory in Java.</h2>
<h2>By using these methods, you can find out how much of the heap is  used and how much heap space still remains.</h2>
<h2>Runtime.freeMemory() returns amount of free memory in bytes.  Runtime.totalMemory() returns total memory in bytes.</h2>
<h2>Runtime.maxMemory() returns maximum memory in bytes.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>435.	What is the difference between  x == y and x.equals(y) expressions in  Java?</b></h1>
<h2>The x == y expression does object reference matching if both a and  b are an object and only returns true if both are pointing to the same  object in the heap space.</h2>
<h2>The x.equals(y) expression is used for logical mapping and it is  expected from an object to override this method to provide logical  equality.</h2>
<h2>Eg. A Book object may be logically equal to another copy of same  Book, but it is a different object which will be false while doing x</h2>
<h2>== y.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>436.	How can you guarantee that  the garbage collection takes place?</b></h1>
<p>No. We cannot guarantee the garbage  collection in Java. Java  documentation explicitly says that GarbageCollection is not  guaranteed.</p>
<p>You can call System.gc() to request garbage collection, however,  that's what it is - a request. It is upto GC's discretion to run.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>437.	What is the relation between  x.hashCode() method and x.equals(y)  method of Object class?</b></h1>
<p>x.hashCode() method returns an int hash value corresponding to an  object instance.</p>
<p>It is used in hashCode based collection classes like Hashtable,  HashMap, LinkedHashMap etc.</p>
<p>hashCode() method is also related to equals() method.</p>
<p>As per Java specification, two objects which are equal to each  other using equals() method must have same hash code.</p>
<p>Therefore, two objects with same hashCode may or may not be  equal to each other. But two equal objects should have same hash  code.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>438.	What is a compile time  constant in Java?</b></h1>
<p>A compile time constant is public static final variable. The public  modifier is optional here. At compile time, they are replaced with  actual values because compiler knows their value up-front and it  also knows that it cannot be changed during run-time. So they are  constants.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>439.	Explain the difference between  fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?</b></h1>
<p>The main difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators is  whether or not the collection can be modified while it is being  iterated.</p>
<p>Fail-safe iterators allow modification of collection in an iteration  task. But fail-fast iterators do not allow any modification to  collection during iteration.</p>
<p>During iteration, fail-fast iterators fail as soon as they realize that  the collection has been modified. Modification can be addition,  removal or update of a member. And it will throw a  ConcurrentModificationException.</p>
<p>Eg. ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap are fail-fast.</p>
<p>Fail-safe iterators operate on a copy of the collection. Therefore  they do not throw an exception if the collection is modified during  iteration.</p>
<p>Eg. ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList are fail-safe.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>440.	You have a character array  and a String. Which one is more  secure to store sensitive data (like  password, date of birth, etc.)?</b></h1>
<p>Short answer is, it is safe to store sensitive information in character  array.</p>
<p>In Java, String is immutable and it is stored in the String pool. Once  a String is created, it stays in the pool in memory until it is garbage  collected. You have no control on garbage collection. Therefore,  anyone having access to a memory dump can potentially extract the  sensitive data and use it.</p>
<p>Whereas, if you use a mutable object like a character array, to store  the value, you can set it to blank once you are done with it. Once it  is made blank it cannot be used by anyone else.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>441.	Why do you use volatile  keyword in Java?</b></h1>
<p>The volatile keyword guarantees global ordering on reads and  writes to a variable. This implies that every thread accessing a  volatile field will read the variable’s current value instead of using  a cached value.</p>
<p>By marking the variable volatile, the value of a variable is never  cached thread-locally. All reads and writes will go straight to main  memory of Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>442. What is the difference between  poll() and remove() methods of Queue  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>It is a basic question to know the understanding of Queue data  structure. Both poll() and remove() methods remove and return the  head of the Queue.</p>
<p>When Queue is empty, poll() method fails and it returns null, but  remove() method fails and throws Exception.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>443.	Can you catch an exception  thrown by another thread in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, it can be done by using Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler.</p>
<p>Java Documentation says “When a thread is about to terminate due  to an uncaught exception the Java Virtual Machine will query the  thread	for</p>
<p>its UncaughtExceptionHandler using<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#getUncaughtExceptionHandler()"><u><font color="#0000FF">Thread.getUncaughtExceptionH</u></font></a></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">will invoke the handler's uncaughtException method, passing the  thread and the exception as arguments.”</font></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>444.	How do you decide which type  of Inner Class – Static or Non-Static  to use in Java?</b></h1>
<p>An inner class has full access to the fields and methods of the  enclosing class. This is convenient for event handlers, but comes at  a cost. Every instance of an inner class retains and requires a  reference to its enclosing class.</p>
<p>Due to this cost, there are many situations where static nested  classes are preferred over inner classes. When instances of the  nested class outlive instances of the enclosing class, the nested  class should be static to prevent memory leaks.</p>
<p>At times, due to their “hidden” reference to enclosing class, Inner  classes are harder to construct via reflection.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>445.	What are the different types of  Classloaders in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>Java Classloader is the part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)  that loads classes on demand into Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</h2>
<h2>When the JVM is started, three types of class loaders are used:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap Classloader: It loads core java API file rt.jar classes  from folder.</li>
<li>Extension Classloader: It loads jar files from lib/ext folder.</li>
<li>System/Application Classloader: It loads jar files from path  specified in the CLASSPATH environment variable.</li>
<h2>Classes may be loaded from the local file system, a remote file  system, or even the web.</h2>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>446.	What are the situations in  which you choose HashSet or  TreeSet?</b></h1>
<h2>HashSet is better than TressSet in almost every way. It gives O(1)  for add(), remove() and contains() operations. Whereas, TressSet  gives O(log(N)) for these operations.</h2>
<h2>Still, TreeSet is useful when you wish to maintain order over the  inserted elements or query for a range of elements within the set.</h2>
<h2>We should use TreeSet when we want to maintain order. Or when  there are enough read operations to offset the increased cost of  write operations.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>447.	What is the use of method  references in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Java 8 has introduced Method references. It allows constructors and  methods to be used as lambdas.</p>
<p>The	main	uses	of	Method	reference	are	to	improve	code  organization, clarity and terseness.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>448.	Do you think Java Enums are  more powerful than integer  constants?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. Java Enums provide many features that integer constants  cannot. Enums can be considered as final classes with a fixed  number of instances. Enums can implement interfaces but cannot  extend another class.</p>
<p>While implementing the strategy pattern, we can use this feature of  Enums. Especially, when the number of strategies is fixed.</p>
<p>You can also attach meta-data to enum values in Java. Also enum  values are typesafe, where as integer constants are not.</p>
<p>You can also define custom behavior in enum values.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>449.	Why do we use static  initializers in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>In Java, a static initializer can run code during the initial loading of  a class and it guarantees that this code will only run once. Also the  static code will finish running before a class can be accessed in any  way.</h2>
<h2>Initializing static members from constructors is more work. You  have to make sure that every constructor does this. You need to  maintain a flag to mark the static work when it is done. You may  have to think about synchronization or races conditions for work in  static block not initialized from static context.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>450.	Your client is complaining that</b></h1>
<p><b>your code is throwing  NoClassDefFoundError or  NoSuchMethodError, even though  you are able to compile your code  without error and method exists in  your code. What could be the reason  behind this?</b></p>
<p>Sometimes we upgrade our libraries even with same method name.  But we forget to let the client know about the new version. Due this</p>
<p>NoSuchMethodError	at	runtime	when	one	library	was</p>
<p>different	in	version,	we	get	NoClassDefFoundError	or</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>compatible with such an upgrade.</p>
<p>Java build tools and IDEs can also produce dependency reports that  tell you which libraries depend on that JAR. Mostly, identifying and  upgrading the library that depends on the older JAR resolve the  issue.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>451.	How can you check if a String  is a number by using regular  expression?</b></h1>
<p>Regex is a powerful tool for  matching patterns and searching  patterns.</p>
<p>A numeric String can only contain digits i.e. 0 to 9. It can also  contain + and - sign at start of the String. We can create a regular  expression for these two rules. One simple example is as follows:</p>
<p>Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(&quot;.*\\D.*&quot;);</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>452.	What is the difference between  the expressions String s =  &quot;Temporary&quot; and String s = new  String(&quot;Temporary &quot;)? Which one is  better and more efficient?</b></h1>
<p>In general, String s = &quot; Temporary &quot; is more efficient to use than  String s = new String(&quot;Temporary &quot;).</p>
<p>In case of String s = &quot; Temporary &quot;, a String with the value  “Temporary” is created in String pool. If another String with the  same value is created (e.g., String s2 = &quot; Temporary &quot;), it will  reference the same object in the String pool.</p>
<p>But, when you use String s = new String(&quot;Temporary &quot;), Java  creates a String with the value “Temporary” in the String pool.  Also, that String object is then passed to the constructor of the  String Object i.e. new String(&quot;Temporary &quot;). And this call creates  another String object (not in the String pool) with that value.</p>
<p>Therefore, each such call creates an additional String object. E.g.  String s2 = new String(&quot;Temporary &quot;) creates an extra String object,  rather than just reusing the same String object from the String pool.</p>
<p>So String s = “Temporary” is always an efficient way.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>453.	In Java, can two equal objects  have the different hash code?</b></h1>
<p>No. It is not possible for two equal objects to have different  hashcode. But two objects with same hashcode may or may not be  equal.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>454.	How can we print an Array in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>We can print an array by using methods of Arrays class. We can  either use Arrays.toString() method or we can use  Arrays.deepToString() method.</p>
<p>Since array doesn't implement toString() method by itself, just  passing an array to System.out.println() will not print its contents.  But we can use Arrays.toString() to print each element of an array.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>455.	Is it ok to use random numbers  in the implementation of hashcode()  method in Java?</b></h1>
<p>No. The hashcode of an object should be always same. If you use  random number in hashcode() method, then you may get a different  value of hashcode for same object. This will break the hashcode  contract.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>456.	Between two types of  dependency injections, constructor  injection and setter dependency  injection, which one is better?</b></h1>
<p>Constructor injection guarantees that a class will be initialized with  all its dependencies during creation. But setter injection provides  flexibility to set an optional dependency.</p>
<p>If we are using an XML file to describe dependencies, the setter  injection is more readable.</p>
<p>In general, it is a good practice to use constructor injection for  mandatory dependencies and use setter injection for optional  dependencies.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>457.	What is the difference between  DOM and SAX parser in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, Document Object Model (DOM) parser loads the whole  XML into memory and creates a tree based on DOM model. This  helps it in quickly locating the nodes, and making a change in the  structure of XML.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Simple API for XML (SAX) parser is an event  based parser. It doesn't load the whole XML into memory. Due to  this reason DOM is faster than SAX but require more memory and  is not suitable to parse large XML files.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>458.	Between Enumeration and  Iterator, which one has better  performance in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Enumeration interface is a read-only interface. It has better  performance than Iterator. It is almost twice as fast as compared to  an Iterator. It also uses very less memory. Also Enumeration does  not have remove() method.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Iterator interface is safer than Enumeration, since  it can check whether a collection is modified or not during iteration.  If a collection is altered while an Iterator is iterating, then it throws  ConcurrentModificationException.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>459.	What is the difference between  pass by reference and pass by value?</b></h1>
<p>Whenever an object is passed by value, it means that a copy of the  object is passed. Even if changes are made to that object, it doesn’t  affect the original value.</p>
<p>Whenever an object is passed by reference, it means that the actual  object is not passed, rather a reference of the object is passed.  Therefore, any changes made by an external method, are also  reflected in the actual object and its reference.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>460.	What are the different ways to</b></h1>
<p><b>sort a collection in Java?</b></p>
<p>The most popular way to sort a collection in Java is by calling  Collections.sort() method. You can provide your custom  Comparator to sort() method for sorting the data in your custom  way.</p>
<p>The other way is to use a Sorted collection like TreeSet or TreeMap  that stores the information in a sorted order and then you can  convert it to a List.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>461.	Why Collection interface  doesn’t extend Cloneable and  Serializable interfaces?</b></h1>
<p>Collection interface just specifies groups of objects known as  elements. Each concrete implementation of a Collection can choose  its own way of how to maintain and order its elements.</p>
<p>Some collections may allow duplicate keys, while other collections  may not.</p>
<p>A lot of collection implementations have clone method. But many do  not. It is not worthwhile to include it in all, since Collection is an  abstract representation. What matters is the concrete  implementation.</p>
<p>Cloning and serialization come into picture while doing concrete  implementation. Therefore, the concrete implementations of  collections should decide how they can be cloned or serialized.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>462.	What is the difference between  a process and a thread in Java?</b></h1>
<p>A process is simply an execution of a program.</p>
<p>A Thread is a single execution sequence within a process.</p>
<p>A process may contain multiple threads. A Thread is also called as  a lightweight process.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>463. What are the benefits of using  an unordered array over an ordered  array?</b></h1>
<p>In an ordered array the search time has time complexity of O(log n).  Whereas, in an unordered array, search time complexity is O (n).</p>
<p>In an ordered array, the insert operation has a time complexity of  O(n). Whereas, the insertion operation for an unordered array takes  constant time of O(1).</p>
<p>Therefore, when we have more writes than reads, it is preferable to  use an unordered array.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>464.	Between HashSet and TreeSet  collections in Java, which one is  better?</b></h1>
<h2>A HashSet is Implemented using a HashTable. Therefore, its  elements are stored in a random order. The add(), remove(), and  contains() methods of a HashSet have constant time complexity  O(1).</h2>
<h2>A TreeSet is implemented using a tree data structure. The elements  in a TreeSet are sorted in a natural order. Therefore, add(),  remove(), and contains() methods have time complexity of O(logn).</h2>
<h2>So from performance perspective, HashSet has better performance  than TreeSet. But if you want to store elements in a natural sorting  order, then TreeSet is a better collection.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>465.	When does JVM call the  finalize() method?</b></h1>
<p>JVM instructs the Garbage Collector to call the finalize method, just  before releasing an object from the memory. A programmer can  implement finalize() method to explicitly release the resources held  by the object. This will help in better memory management and  avoid any memory leaks.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>466.	When would you use Serial  Garabage collector or Throughput  Garbage collector in Java?</b></h1>
<p>The Serial Garbage collector is used for small applications that  require heap memory upto 100 MB.</p>
<p>The Throughput Garbage collector is used in medium to large size  Java applications.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>467.	In Java, if you set an object  reference to null, will the Garbage  Collector immediately free the  memory held by that object?</b></h1>
<p>No. JVM decides to run the Garbage Collector whenever it is low  on memory. When Garbage Collector runs, it looks for objects that  are available for garbage collection and then frees the memory  associated with this object.</p>
<p>So just setting an Object reference null makes it eligible for  Garbage Collection, but it does not immediately free the memory.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>468.	How can you make an Object  eligible for Garbage collection in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>To make an Object eligible for Garbage collection, just make sure  that it is unreachable to the  program in which it is currently defined</p>
<p>/ created / used. You can set the object reference to null and make</p>
<p>sure no other object refers it. Once the object cannot be reached,  Garbage Collection can clean it during the next run.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>469. When do you use Exception or  Error in Java? What is the difference  between these two?</b></h1>
<h2>Throwable class is the superclass of Exception and Error classes in  Java.</h2>
<h2>When you want to catch the exceptional conditions that your  program can create or encounter, then use the Exception class or  subclass of Exception.</h2>
<h2>When you come across situations that are unexpected then use Error  class in Java. Also recovering from Error is not possible in most of  cases. So it is better to terminate the program.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>470.	What is the advantage of  PreparedStatement over Statement  class in Java?</b></h1>
<p>PreparedStatements are precompiled statements for database  queries. Due to this their performance is much better. Also, we can  reuse PreparedStatement objects with different input values to the  same query.</p>
<p>Where as, Statement class does not provide these features.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>471.	In Java, what is the difference  between throw and throws keywords?</b></h1>
<p>When we want to raise an exception in our code, we use the throw  keyword with the name of the exception to be raised.</p>
<p>Where as, throws keyword is used in method declaration. Throws  keyword tells us the Exception that can be thrown by this method.  Any caller of this method should  be prepared to expect this  Exception.</p>
<p>Another minor difference is that throw is used only with one  exception, but throws can be used with comma-separated list of  multiple exceptions.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>472.	What happens to the Exception  object after the exception handling is  done?</b></h1>
<p>Once the exception handling is complete, the Exception object is not  reachable. Then it is garbage collected in the next run of Garbage  Collector.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>473.	How do you find which client  machine is sending request to your  servlet in Java?</b></h1>
<p>We can use the ServletRequest class to find the IP address or host  name of the client machine.</p>
<p>There are methods getRemoteAddr() to get the IP address of the  client machine and getRemoteHost() to get the host name of the  client machine.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>474.	What is the difference between  a Cookie and a Session object in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Both Cookie and Session are used during communication between  Client and Server. The Client can disable a Cookie. Due to which  the Web server cannot send a cookie. But a client cannot disable a  session. So a Session always works irrespective of any setting at  the client side.</p>
<p>Also a Session can store any Java object. But the Cookie can only  store small information in a String object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>475. Which protocol does Browser  and Servlet use to communicate with  each other?</b></h1>
<p>HTTP protocol. The Browser and Servlet communicate with each  other by using the HTTP protocol.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>476.	What is HTTP Tunneling?</b></h1>
<p>There are many network communication protocols on the Internet.  But HTTP is the most popular among them. HTTP Tunneling is a  technique in which HTTP or HTTPS protocol encapsulated the  communication done by any other type of protocol. The masking of  other protocol requests as HTTP requests is known as HTTP  Tunneling.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>477.	Why do we use JSP instead of  Servlet in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Since JSP pages are dynamically compiled into servlets, the  programmers can easily make updates to the presentation layer  code.</p>
<p>For better performance, JSP pages can be pre-compiled.</p>
<p>Also JSP pages provide flexibility to combine static templates like  HTML or XML snippets.</p>
<p>In addition, programmers can make logic changes at the class level,  without editing the JSP pages that use the class logic.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>478.	Is empty ‘.java’ file name a  valid source file name in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. You can create a class and store it in a file with name .java.  You can try it yourself, by creating, compiling and running such a  file. It will run correctly.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>479.	How do you implement Servlet  Chaining in Java?</b></h1>
<p>To implement, Servlet Chaining, there has to be more than one  servlet. The output of one servlet has to be sent to a second servlet.  The output of the second servlet can be sent to a third servlet, and  so on. In this way, a chain of servlets is formed to complete a task.</p>
<p>The last servlet in the chain will be responsible for sending final  response to client.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>480.	Can you instantiate this class?</b></h1>
<p>public class A</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>A a = new A();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>No,  this	class	cannot   be   instantiated,   since it  will	result in  recursively calling its constructor.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>481.	Why Java does not support  operator overloading?</b></h1>
<p>Java supports Method overloading but does not support operator  overloading. It would make the design more complex by adding  operator loading. Also it will make more complex compiler.</p>
<p>One more reason is that, it will reduce the performance of JVM by  operator overloading, since JCM has to do extra work to find the  real meaning of overloaded operators at run time.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>482.	Why String class is Immutable  or Final in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>Since String objects are cached in a String pool, it makes sense to  make the String immutable. The cached String literals are shared  between multiple clients. And there is a possibility that one client's  action may affect another client’s access to String pool.</h2>
<h2>String is also used as a parameter in many Java classes. Eg. You can  pass hostname, port number as String while opening a network  connection. If any one can modify your copy of the String, it can  change the hostname. Due to this reason, it makes sense to make  String final as soon as it is created.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>483.	What is the difference between  sendRedirect and forward methods?</b></h1>
<h2>When you use sendRedirect method, it creates a new request. When  you use the forward method, it just forwards a request to a new  target.</h2>
<h2>In case of sendRedirect, the previous request scope objects are not  available, because it creates a new request.</h2>
<h2>In case of forward method, the previous request scope objects are  available after forwarding.</h2>
<h2>Also the sendRedirect method is considered slower than the  forward method.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>484.	How do you fix your  Serializable class, if it contains a  member that is not serializable?</b></h1>
<p>If you want to make a class Serializable, but find that this class  contains members that are not Serializable, then you have to mark  those members as transient. This will ensure that this member is not  persisted to a stream of bytes during Serialization.</p>
<p>Therefore, Transient keyword of Java comes to help in this  scenario.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>485.	What is the use of run time  polymorphism in Java?</b></h1>
<p>During the run time the behavior of an Object can change based on  its run time state. Due to this run time polymorphism is introduced  in Java. If you override a method in a child class, then you are  providing run time polymorphism. Nothing will happen at the  compile time. But at the run time, JVM decides which method will  be called based on the class of the Object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>486.	What are the rules of method  overloading and method overriding in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>When we want to overload a method, we need to make sure that the  method name remains same. But method signature can vary in the  number or datatype of arguments or in the order of arguments.</p>
<p>When we want to override a method, we ensure that the method is  not throwing checked exceptions that are new or higher than those  declared by the overridden method. Also we make sure that the  method name, arguments and return type remain the same.</p>
<p>Also we cannot override Static and Final methods in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>487.	What is the difference between  a class and an object in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>A Class is a template or a blue print of an Object to be created. An  Object is an instance of a Class. A Class defines the methods and  member variables. But an Object populates the values of the  member variables.</h2>
<h2>Therefore a class is a blueprint that you use to create objects. An  object is an instance of a class – it is a concrete 'thing' that you  made using a specific class.</h2>
<h2>Most of the OOPS concepts are valid only when an Object is  created.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>488.	Can we create an abstract class  that extends another abstract class?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. An abstract class can extend another abstract class. It does not  need to define the methods of parent abstract class. Only the last  non-abstract class has to define the abstract methods of a parent  abstract class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>489.	Why do you use Upcasting or  Downcasting in Java ?</b></h1>
<p>When we want to cast a Sub class to Super class, we use Upcasting.  It is also known as widening. Upcasting is always allowed in Java.</p>
<p>When we want to cast a Super class to Sub class, we use  Downcasting. It is also known as narrowing.</p>
<p>At times, Downcasting can throw the ClassCastException if it fails  the type check.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>490. What is the reason to organize  classes and interfaces in a package in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>As the name suggests, a package contains a collection of classes. It  helps in setting the category of a file. Like- whether it is a Data  Access Object (DAO) or an API.</p>
<p>It helps in preventing the collision of Name space.</p>
<p>Also we can introduce access restriction by using package and the  right modifiers on a class and its methods.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>491.	What is information hiding in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>Information hiding is OOPS  concept. In Java  you can use  encapsulation to do Information hiding. An object can use the access  modifiers like-public, private, protected to hide its internal details  from another object. This helps in decoupling the internal logic of  an object from outside world.</p>
<p>By using Information hiding, an object can change its internal  implementation without impacting the outside calling client’s code.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>492.	Why does Java provide default  constructor?</b></h1>
<p>In Java all the interaction takes place between Object instances. To  create an Object instance, JVM needs a constructor. Java does not  enforce the rule on a programmer to define a default constructor for  every class.</p>
<p>Whenever an object has to be created and programmer has not  provided a constructor, Java uses default constructor to create the  object. Default constructor also initializes member variables with  their default values.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>493.	What is the difference between  super and this keywords in Java?</b></h1>
<p>We use super keyword to access the methods of the super class from  child class.</p>
<p>We use this keyword to access methods of the same class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>494.	What is the advantage of using  Unicode characters in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Unicode characters have much larger number of characters in the  specification.</p>
<p>They also contain Asian and non-western European characters.</p>
<p>Most of the modern technologies, websites and browsers support  these Unicode characters.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>495.	Can you override an  overloaded method in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. Java allows to override an overloaded method, if that method  is not a static or final method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>496.	How can we change the heap  size of a JVM?</b></h1>
<p>Java provides the command line parameters to set the heap size for  JVM.</p>
<p>You can specify the values in –Xms and –Xmx parameters. These</p>
<p>parameters stand for initial and maximum heap size of JVM.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>497.	Why should you define a  default constructor in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>In general, Java provides a default constructor with each class. But  there are certain cases when we want to define our own version of  default constructor.</h2>
<h2>When we want to construct an object with default values, we create  our default constructor.</h2>
<h2>At times, we can mark the default constructor private. So that any  other class cannot create an instance of our class. This technique is  generally used in Singleton design pattern.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>498.	How will you make an Object  Immutable in Java?</b></h1>
<p>To make an object immutable follow these two rules. One, do not  use any setter methods that can change the fields of your class. Two,  make the fields final. By following these rules, the member  variables cannot be changed after initialization. This will ensure  that member variables of an Object do not change. And thus the  Object will be considered Immutable.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>499.	How can you prevent SQL  Injection in Java Code?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, you can use PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection. In  a PreparedStatement you can pass the precompiled SQL queries  with pre-defined parameters. This helps in checking the type of  parameters to SQL queries. So it protects your code from SQL  injection attacks.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>500.	Which two methods should be</b></h1>
<p><b>always implemented by HashMap key  Object?</b></p>
<p>Any object that we want to use as key for HashMap or in any other  hash based collection data structure e.g. Hashtable, or  ConcurrentHashMap must implement equals() and hashCode()  method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>501.Why an Object used as Key in  HashMap should be Immutable?</b></h1>
<p>The Key object should be immutable so that hashCode() method  always return the same value for that object.</p>
<p>The Hashcode returned by hashCode() method depends on values of  member variables of an object. If an object is mutable, then the  member variables can change. Once the member variables change,  the Hashcode changes. If the same object returns different hash code  at different times, then it is not reliable to be used in the HashMap.</p>
<p>Let say, when you insert the object, the Hashcode is X,  the  HashMap will store it in bucket X. But when you search for it the  Hashcode is Y, then HashMap will look for the object in bucket Y.  So you are not getting what you stored.</p>
<p>To solve this, a key object should be immutable.</p>
<p>Although, the compiler does not enforce this rule, a good  programmer always remembers this rule.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>502.	How can we share an object  between multiple threads?</b></h1>
<p>There are many ways to share same object between multiple  threads. You can use a BlockingQueue to pass an object from one  thread to another thread.</p>
<p>You can also use Exchanger class for this purpose. An Exchanger is  a bidirectional form of a SynchronousQueue in Java. You can use it  to swap the objects as well.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>503.	How can you determine if your  program has a deadlock?</b></h1>
<h2>If we suspect that our application is stuck due to a Deadlock, then  we just take a thread dump by using the command specific to  environment in which your application is running. Eg. In Linux you  can use command kill -3.</h2>
<h2>In case of deadlock, you will see in thread dump the current status  and stack trace of threads in the JVM, and one or more of them will  be stuck with message deadlock.</h2>
<h2>Also you can do this programmatically by using the ThreadMXBean  class that ships with the JDK.</h2>
<h2>If you don't need programmatic detection you can do this via  JConsole. On the thread tab there is a &quot;detect deadlock&quot; button.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Mixed Questions</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>1.	What are Wrapper classes in Java?</b></h1>
<h2>Java has concept of Wrapper classes to allow primitive types to be  accessed as objects. Primitive types like boolean, int, double, float  etc. have corresponding Wrappers classes – Boolean, Integer,  Double, Float etc.</h2>
<h2>Many of these Wrapper classes are in java.lang package.</h2>
<h2>Java 5.0 has launched the concept of Autoboxing and Unboxing in  Java for Wrapper classes.</h2>
<h2>E.g.</h2>
<h2>public class WrapperTest{</h2>
<h2>public static void main(String args[]){</h2>
<h2>//Converting int into Integer  int count=50;</h2>
<h2>Integer i=Integer.valueOf(count);//converting int into Integer</h2>
<p>Integer	j=a;//autoboxing,	now	compiler	will</p>
<p>write</p>
<p>Integer.valueOf(count) internally</p>
<p>System.out.println(count+&quot; &quot;+i+&quot; &quot;+j);</p>
<p>}}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>2.	What is the purpose of native  method in Java?</b></h1>
<p>The native keyword is used for applying to a method to indicate that  the method is implemented in native code using JNI(Java Native  Interface).</p>
<p>Therefore, native methods allow Java Developer to directly access  platform specific APIs.</p>
<p>Often, native methods are linked to native library.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>3.	What is System class?</b></h1>
<p>System.class is a final class provided by java.lang package. It  contains several useful class fields and methods.</p>
<p>The purpose of System class is to provide access to system  resources.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>4. What is System, out and println in  System.out.println method call?</b></h1>
<p>System is a final class provided by java.lang package.</p>
<p>out refers to PrintStream class and a static member of System class.  println is a method of PrintStream class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>5.	What is the other name of Shallow  Copy in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Object Cloning. A Shallow Copy just copies the values of references in a  Class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>6.	What is the difference between  Shallow Copy and Deep Copy in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>A Shallow copy just copies the values of the references in the class.  A Deep copy copies the values of the objects as well.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>7.	What is a Singleton class?</b></h1>
<p>A Singleton class in Java has maximum one instance of the class  present in JVM, all the time. The constructor of this class is written  in such a way that it never creates more than one object of same  class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>8.	What is the difference between  Singleton class and Static class?</b></h1>
<p>A static class in Java has only static methods. It is a container of  functions. It is created based on procedural programming design.</p>
<p>Singleton class is a pattern in Object Oriented Design. A Singleton  class has only one instance of an object in JVM. This pattern is  implemented in such a way that there is always only one instance of  that class present in JVM.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>9.	What are the implicit objects in  JSP?</b></h1>
<p>JSP has following implicit objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request</li>
<li>Response</li>
<li>Application</li>
<li>Exception</li>
<li>Page</li>
<li>Config</li>
<li>Session</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>10.How will you extend JSP code?</b></h1>
<p>We can extend JSP code by using Tag libraries and Custom actions.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>11. How will you handle runtime  exceptions in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We use Errorpage attribute in JSP to catch runtime exceptions. This  attribute forwards user request to the error page automatically.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>12.How will you prevent multiple  submits of a page that come by  clicking refresh button multiple  times?</b></h1>
<p>We can use Post Redirect Get (PRG) pattern to solve the issue of  multiple submission of same data. It works as follows:</p>
<p>First time when a user submits a form to server by POST or GET  method, then we update the state in application database.</p>
<p>Then we send a redirect response to send reply to client.</p>
<p>Then we load a view by using GET command. There is no data is  sent in this. Since this a new JSP page, it is safe from multiple  submits. The code that processes the request is idempotent. So it  does not do same action twice for same request.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>13.How will you implement a thread  safe JSP page?</b></h1>
<p>We can use SingleThreadModel Interface to implement a thread safe  JSP page.</p>
<p>We can also add &lt;%@page isThreadSafe=”false” %&gt; directive in  JSP page to make it thread safe.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>14.How will you include a static file in  a JSP page?</b></h1>
<p>We can use include directive of JSP to include a Static page in JSP.  In this approach, we use translation phase to include a static page.  We have to specify the URL of the resource to be included as file  attribute in this directive.</p>
<p>E.g. &lt;%@ include file=&quot;footer.html&quot; %&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>15.What are the lifecycle methods of a  JSP?</b></h1>
<p>A JSP has following lifecycle methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>jspInit</b>(): This method is invoked when the JSP is called  for the first time. We can do initial setup for servicing a  request in this method.</li>
<li>_<b>jspService</b>(): This method is used to serve every request  of the JSP.</li>
<li><b>jspDestroy</b>(): Once we remove a JSP from the container,  we call this method. It is used for cleanup of resources like  Database connections etc.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>16.What are the advantages of using  JSP in web architecture?</b></h1>
<p>We get following advantages by using JSP in web architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Performance</b>: JSP provides very good performance due to  their design of using same code to service multiple  requests.</li>
<li><b>Fast</b>: Since JSP is pre-compiled, server can serve the  pages very fast.</li>
<li><b>Extendable</b>: JSP is based on Java Servlets. This helps in  extending JSP architecture with other Java technologies  like JDBC, JMS, JNDI etc.</li>
<li><b>Design</b>: It is easier to design user interface with JSP, since  it is very close to HTML. UI designers can create a JSP  with mock data and developers can later provide  implementation of dynamic data.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>17.What is the advantage of JSP over  Javascript?</b></h1>
<p>In JSP we can write Java code seamlessly. It allows for writing  code that can interact with the rest of the application.</p>
<p>Javascript code is mostly executed at client side. This limits the  tasks that can be done in Javascript code. We cannot connect to  database server from Javascript at the client side.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>18.What is the Lifecycle of JSP?</b></h1>
<p>JSP has following lifecycle stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Compilation</b>: When a request is made for  a JSP, the  corresponding JSP is converted into Servlet and compiled.  If there is already a compiled form of JSP and there is not  change in JSP page since last compilation, this stage does  not do anything.</li>
<li><b>Initialization</b>: In this stage, jspInit() method is called to  initialize any data or code that will be later used multiple  times in _jspService() method.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.	<b>Service</b>:	In	this</p>
<p>stage,	with	each	request	to	JSP,</p>
<p>_jspService() method is called to service the request. This  is the core logic of JSP that generates response for request.</p>
<p>4.	<b>Destroy</b>:	In	this</p>
<p>stage,	JSP	is	removed	from	the</p>
<p>container/server. Just before removal, this stage performs  the cleanup of any resources held by JSP.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>19.What is a JSP expression?</b></h1>
<p>A JSP expression is an element of a JSP page that is used to  evaluate a Java expression and convert into a String. This String is  replaced into the locations wherever the expression occurs in JSP  page.</p>
<p>E.g. &lt;%= expression =%&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>20. What are the different types of  directive tags in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>JSP has following directive tags:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Page</b>: This directive is used for page related attributes. It  can be put anywhere in the JSP page. But by convention we  put it on the top of the page.</li>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>&lt;%@ page attribute=&quot;value&quot; %&gt;</p>
<li><b>Taglib</b>: We can create custom tags in JSP and use these by  taglib directive in a JSP page.</li>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>&lt;%@ taglib uri=“abc.html” prefix=“tag_prefix” &gt;</p>
<li><b>Include</b>: We use include directive to read a file and merge  its content with the JSP page. This  is done  during  compilation stage.</li>
<p>&lt;%@ include file=&quot;relative url&quot; &gt;</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>21.What is session attribute in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>Session attribute in JSP is used for HTTP session mechanism. If we  do not want to use HTTP session in JSP, then we set this attribute to  false. If it is set to true, we can use built in session object in JSP.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>22. What are the different scopes of a  JSP object?</b></h1>
<p>A JSP object, implicit or explicit, can have one of the following  scopes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Page</b>: In this scope, the object is accessible from the page  where it was created. Important point here is that when a  user refreshes the page, the objects of this scope also get  created again.</li>
<li><b>Request</b>: In request scope, the object is accessible to the  HTTP request that created this object.</li>
<li><b>Session</b>: In this scope, the object is available throughout  the same HTTP session.</li>
<li><b>Application</b>: This is the widest scope. The object is  available throughout the application in which JSP was  created.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>23. What is pageContext in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>In JSP, pageContext is an implicit object. This is used for storing  and accessing all the page scope objects of JSP.</p>
<p>It is an instance of the PageContext class from javax.servlet.jsp  package.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>24. What is the use of jsp:useBean in  JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We use jsp:useBean to invoke the methods of a Java Bean class.  The Java Bean class has some data and setter/getters to access the  data.</p>
<p>With this tag, container will try to locate the bean. If bean is not  already loaded then it will create an instance of a bean and load it.  Later this bean can be used in expressions or JSP code.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>25. What is difference between  include Directive and include Action  of JSP?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the main differences between include Directive and  include Action are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include directive is called at translation phase to include  content in JSP. Include Action is executed during runtime  of JSP.</li>
<li>It is not possible to pass parameters to include directive.  Include action can accept parameters by jsp:param tag.</li>
<li>Include directive is just copying of content from another  file to JSP code and then it goes through compilation.  Include action will dynamically process the resource being  called and then include it in the JSP page.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>26. How will you use other Java files  of your application in JSP code?</b></h1>
<p>We can use import tag to import a Java file in JSP code. Once a file  is imported, it can be used by JSP code. It is a very convenient  method to use Java classes in JSP code.</p>
<p>For better organization of Java code, we should create a package of  classes that we are planning to use in JSP code.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>27. How will you use an existing class  and extend it to use in the JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We can use extends attribute in include tag to use an existing class  and extend it in the current JSP.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>&lt;%@ include page extends=“parent_class” %&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>28. Why _jspService method starts  with _ symbol in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>All the code that we write in a JSP goes into _jspService method  during translation phase. We cannot override this method. Where as  other lifecycle methods jspInit() and jspDestroy() can be  overridden.</p>
<p>It appears that container uses _ symbol to distinguish the method that  cannot be overridden by client code.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>29. Why do we use tag library in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>At times we want to create a UI framework with custom tags. In  such a scenario, taglib is a very good feature of JSP. With taglib we  can create tags that can provide custom features.</p>
<p>Taglib is also a nice way to communicate with UI designers who  can use custom tags in the html without going into the details of how  the code is implemented.</p>
<p>Another benefit of taglib is reusability of the code. This promotes  writing code only once and using is multiple times.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>30. What is the different type of tag  library groups in JSTL?</b></h1>
<p>JSTL stands for JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library. In JSTL,  we have a collection of JSP tags that can be used in different  scenarios. There are following main groups of tags in JSTL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core tags</li>
<li>SQL tags</li>
<li>Formatting tags</li>
<li>XML tags</li>
<li>JSTL Functions</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>31.How will you pass information  from one JSP to another JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We can pass information from one JSP to another by using implicit  objects. If different JSP are called in same session, we can use  session object to pass information from one JSP to another.</p>
<p>If we want to pass information from one JSP to another JSP  included in the main JSP, then we can use jsp:param to pass this  information.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>32. How will you call a stored  procedure from JSP?</b></h1>
<p>JSP allows running Java code from a .jsp file. We can call a stored  procedure by using JDBC code.</p>
<p>We can call a CallableStatement from JSP code to invoke a stored  procedure.</p>
<p>If we are using Spring framework, then we can use JdbcTemplate  class to invoke stored procedure from a JSP.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>33. Can we override _jspService()  method in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>No, JSP specification does not allow overriding of _jspService  method in JSP. We can override other methods like jspInit() and  jspDestroy().</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>34. What is a directive in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>JSP directive is a mechanism to pass message to JSP container. JSP  directive does not produce an output to the page. But it  communicates with JSP container.</p>
<p>E.g. &lt;%@include ..%&gt; directive is used for telling JSP container  to include the content of another file during translation of JSP.</p>
<p>There can be zero or more attributes in a directive to pass  additional information to JSP container.</p>
<p>Some of the important directives in JSP are: page, include and  taglib.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>35. How will you implement Session  tracking in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We can use different mechanisms to implement Session tracking  JSP. Some these mechanisms are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cookies</b>: We can use cookie to set session information and  pass it to web client. In subsequent requests we can use the  information in cookie to track session.</li>
<li><b>Hidden Form Field</b>: We can send session id in a hidden  field in HTML form. By using this we can track session.</li>
<li><b>Session object</b>: We can use the built in session object to  track session in JSP.</li>
<li><b>URL Rewriting</b>: We can also add session id at the end of  a URL.</li>
<p>Like- <a href="http://www.abcserver.com/?sessionid=1234"><u><font color="#0000FF">www.abcserver.com?sessionid=1234</u></font></a></p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>36. How do you debug code in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>In simplest form we can write logger statements or  System.out.println() statements to write messages to log files. When  we call a JSP, the log messages get written to logs. With useful  information getting logged we can easily debug the code.</p>
<p>Another option in debugging is to link JSP container with an IDE.  Once we link IDE debugger to JSP Engine, we can use standard  operations of debugging like breakpoint, step through etc.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>37. How will you implement error  page in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>To implement an error-handling page in JSP, we first create a JSP  with error page handling information. In most of the cases we  gracefully handle error by giving a user-friendly message like  “Sorry! There is system error. Please try again by refreshing page.”</p>
<p>In this error page, we show user-friendly message to user, but we  also log important information like stack trace to our application log  file.</p>
<p>We have to add parameter isErrorPage=true in page directive of this  page. This tells to JSP container that this is our error page.</p>
<p>&lt;%@page isErrorPage=”true” %&gt;</p>
<p>Now we can use this error page in other JSP where we want to  handle error. In case of an error or exception, these JSP will direct  it to errorPage.</p>
<p>&lt;% page errorPage=”ErrorPage.jsp” %&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>38. How will you send XML data from  a JSP?</b></h1>
<p>In general, JSP is used to pass HTML data to web browser. If we  want to send data in XML format, we can easily do it by setting  contentType=”text/xml” in page directive.</p>
<p>E.g. &lt;%@page contentType=”text/xml” %&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>39. What happens when we request  for a JSP page from web browser?</b></h1>
<h2>When a user calls JSP page from web browser, the request first  comes to web server. Web server checks for .jsp extension of page  and passes the request to JSP container like Tomcat.</h2>
<h2>The JSP container checks whether it has precompiled JSP class or  not. If this is the first time this JSP is called, then JSP container will  translate JSP into a servlet and compiles it.</h2>
<h2>After compiling, JSP code if loaded in memory and JSP container  will call jspInit() method and _jspService() methods.</h2>
<h2>The _jspService() method will create the output that will be sent by  JSP container to client browser.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>40. How will you implement Auto  Refresh of page in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We can use setIntHeader() method to set the refresh frequency with  which we want to auto-refresh a JSP page.</p>
<p>We can send key “Refresh” with the time in seconds for auto refresh  of the JSP page.</p>
<p>E.g. response.setIntHeader(“Refresh”,10)</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>41.What are the important status  codes in HTTP?</b></h1>
<p>Every HTTP request comes back with a status code from the server.  The important status codes in HTTP are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>200: It means the request is successful.</li>
<li>400: It means the request was bad.</li>
<li>401: It means request was not authorized.</li>
<li>404: It means the resource requested was not found.</li>
<li>503: It means the service is not available.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>42. What is the meaning of Accept  attribute in HTTP header?</b></h1>
<p>In HTTP header, Accept attribute is used to specify the MIME types  that a HTTP client or browser can handle. MIME type is the  identifier for specifying the type of file/data that we are planning to  pass over the internet.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>43. What is the difference between  Expression and Scriptlet in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We use Expression in a JSP to return a value and display it at a  specific location. It is generally used for dynamically print  information like- time, counter etc in a HTML code.</p>
<p>Scriptlet is for writing Java code in a JSP. We can define variable,  methods etc in a Scriptlet. A Scriptlet can handle much more  complex code and can be also reused.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>44. How will you delete a Cookie in  JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We can use following options to delete a Cookie in JSP:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>setMaxAge</b>(): we can set the maximum age of a cookie.  After this time period, Cookie will expire and will be  deleted.</li>
<li><b>Header</b>: We can also set the expiry time in header of  response. Respone.setHeader(). This will also expire the  cookie after specified time period.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>45. How will you use a Cookie in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We can use a Cookie in JSP by performing following steps:</p>
<p>First we create a Cookie object. We set the name and value of the  cookie to be created.</p>
<p>We set the expiry time of the Cookie by setting the maximum age.  We can use setMaxAge() method for this.</p>
<p>Finally, we can send the cookie in a HTTP Response by sending it  in HTTP header. In this way cookie goes to client browser and gets  stored there till the maximum age is not achieved.</p>
<p>Once a Cookie is set in the client browser, we can call getCookies()  method to get the list of all the cookies set in Client. We iterate  through the list of all the cookies and get the value of the cookie that  was set in earlier request.</p>
<p>In this way we can use Cookie to set some information at client side  and retrieve its value.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>46. What is the main difference  between a Session and Cookie in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>A Session is always stored at the Server side. In JSP, session is a  built-in object in JSP container.</p>
<p>A Cookie is always stored at the client side.</p>
<p>We can use both the methods for Session tracking. But Cookie  method needs permission from user for storing cookie at the client  location.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>47. How will you prevent creation of  session in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We can simply set the session attribute as false in page directive to  prevent creation of session object.</p>
<p>E.g. &lt;% @page session=”false” %&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>48. What is an output comment in  JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We can write output in JSP in such a way that it becomes a comment  in HTML code. This comment will not be visible in the web  browser. But when we view page source to see HTML, we can see  output comment.</p>
<p>An HTML comment is of following format:</p>
<p>&lt;!-- comment --&gt;</p>
<p>If we output comment in above format, it will be visible to client.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>49. How will you prevent caching of  HTML output by web browser in  JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We can use set the header in response object for Cache-Control to  specify no caching.</p>
<p>Sample code is as follows:</p>
<p>response.setHeader(“Cache-Control”, “no-store”);  response.setDateHeader(“Expires”,”0”);</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>50. How will you redirect request to  another page in browser in JSP code?</b></h1>
<p>We can use sendRedirect() method in JSP to redirect the request to  another location or page.</p>
<p>In this case the request will not come back to server. It will redirect  in the browser itself.</p>
<p>Sample code is as follows:</p>
<p>&lt;% response.sendRedirect(URL); %&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>51.What is the difference between  sendRedirect and forward in a JSP?</b></h1>
<p>Both forward and sendRedirect are mechanisms of sending a client  to another page. The main difference between these two are as  follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In forward, the processing takes place at server side. In  case of sendRedirect() the processing takes place the  client side.</li>
<li>In forward, the request is transferred to another resource  within same server. In case of sendRedirect the request can  be transferred to resource on some other server.</li>
<li>In forward only one request call is consumed. In case of  sendRedirect two request response calls are created and  consumed.</li>
<li>The forward is declared in RequestDispatcher interface.  Where as sendRedirect is declared in  HttpServletResponse object.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>52. What is the use of config implicit  object in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>In JSP, config object is of type ServletConfig. This object is created  by Servlet Container for each JSP page. It is used for setting  initialization parameters for a specific JSP page.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>53. What is the difference between  init-param and context-param?</b></h1>
<p>We can specify both init-param and context-param in web.xml file.</p>
<p>We use init-param to specify the parameters that are specific to a  servlet or jsp. This information is confined to the scope of that JSP.</p>
<p>We use context-param to specify the parameters for overall  application scope. This information does not change easily. It can  be used by all the JSP/Servlet in that Container.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>54. What is the purpose of  RequestDispatcher?</b></h1>
<p>We use RequestDispatcher interface to forward requests to other  resources like HTML, JSP etc.</p>
<p>It can also be used to include the content of another page in a JSP.  It has two methods: forward and include.</p>
<p>We have to first get the RequestDispatcher object from the container  and then we can call include or forward method on this object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>55. How can be read data from a  Form in a JSP?</b></h1>
<p>There is a built-in request object in a JSP that provides methods to  read Form data. Some of the methods are as follows::</p>
<ul>
<li><b>getParameterNames(): </b>This method returns the list of all  the parameters in the Form.</li>
<li><b>getParameter(): </b>We call this method to get the value of  parameter set in the Form. It returns null if the parameter is  not found.</li>
<li><b>getParameterValues(): </b>If a Parameter is mentioned  multiple times in a Form, we use  request.getParameterValues() method to get all the values.  This method returns an array of String values.</li>
<li><b>getParameterMap(): </b>This method returns the map of all  the Parameters in Form.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>56. What is a filter in JSP?</b></h1>
<p>We can define filters in JSP to intercept requests from a client or to  change response from a server.</p>
<p>Filter is a Java class that is defined in the deployment descriptor of  web.xml of an application. The JSP container reads filter from  web.xml and applies a filter as per the URL pattern associated with  the filter.</p>
<p>JSP Engine loads all the filters in when we start the server.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>57. How can you upload a large file in  JSP?</b></h1>
<p>To upload a file by JSP we can use &lt;input type=”file”&gt; in the Form  data being passed from HTML.</p>
<p>If the file is very large in size, we can set enctype=multipart/form-  data.</p>
<p>We have to use POST method in the Form to send a file.</p>
<p>Once the request is received, we can implement the logic to read  mulitpart data in doPost() method of JSP. There are methods in JSP  framework to read large files via this method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>58. In which scenario, Container  initializes multiple JSP/Servlet  objects?</b></h1>
<p>To initialize multiple JSP objects, we have to specify same Servlet  object multiple times in web.xml.</p>
<p>This indicates to JSP container to initialize separate JSP/Servlet  object for each element. Each of the Servlet instance will have its  own ServletConfig object and parameters.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Java Design Patterns</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>59. When will you use Strategy Design  Pattern in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Strategy pattern is very useful for  implementing a family of  algorithms. It is a behavioral design pattern.</p>
<p>With Strategy pattern we can select the algorithm at runtime. We can  use it to select the sorting strategy for data. We can use it to save  files in different formats like- .txt, .csv, .jpg etc.</p>
<p>In Strategy pattern we create an abstraction, which is an interface  through which clients interact with our system. Behind the  abstraction we create multiple implementation of same interface  with different algorithms.</p>
<p>For a client, at runtime we can vary the algorithm based on the type  of request we have received.</p>
<p>So we use Strategy pattern to hide the algorithm implementation  details from client.</p>
<p>In Java Collections.sort() method uses strategy design pattern.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>60. What is Observer design pattern?</b></h1>
<p>In Observer design pattern, there is a Subject that maintains the list  of Observers that are waiting for any update on the Subject. Once  there is an update in Subject it notifies all the observers for the  change.</p>
<p>E.g. In real life, students are waiting for the result of their test. Here  students are the observers and test is the subject. Once the result of  test is known, testing organization notifies all the students about  their result.</p>
<p>The most popular use of Observer pattern is in Model View  Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.</p>
<p>Main issue with Observer pattern is that it can cause memory leaks.  The subject holds a strong reference to observers. If observers are  not de-registered in time, it can lead to memory leak.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>61.What are the examples of  Observer design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<p>In JDK there are many places where Observer design pattern is  used. Some of these are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>java.util.Observer, java.util.Observable</li>
<li>javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionAttributeListener</li>
<li>javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionBindingListener</li>
<li>All implementations of java.util.EventListener, and also in  Swing packages</li>
<li>javax.faces.event.PhaseListener</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>62. How Strategy design pattern is  different from State design pattern in  Java?</b></h1>
<p>State design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that is use for  defining the state machine for an object. Each state of an object is  defined in a child class of State class. When different actions are  taken on an Object, it can change its state.</p>
<p>Strategy pattern is also a behavioral pattern, but it is mainly used  for defining multiple algorithms. With same action of a client, the  algorithm to be used can change.</p>
<p>Some people consider State pattern similar to Strategy pattern,  since an Object changes its Strategy  with  different method  invocations. But the main difference is that in State pattern internal  state of an Object is one of the determining factors for selecting the  Strategy for change of state.</p>
<p>Where as in Strategy pattern, client can pass some external  parameter in input during method invocation that determines the  strategy to be used at run time.</p>
<p>Therefore State pattern is based on the Object’s internal  state,  where as Strategy pattern is based on Client’s invocation.</p>
<p>State pattern is very useful in increasing the maintainability of the  code in a large code-base.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>63. Can you explain Decorator design  pattern with an example in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Some people call Decorator pattern as Wrapper pattern as well. It  is used to add the behavior to an object, without changing the  behavior of other objects of same class.</p>
<p>One of the very good uses of Decorator pattern is in java.io  package. We can have a FileInputStream to handle a File. To add  Buffering behavior we can decorate FileInputStream with  BufferedInputStream. To add the gzip behavior BufferedInputStream  we can decorate it with GzipInputStream. To add serialization  behavior to GzipInputStream, we can decorate it with  ObjectInputStream.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>Open a FileInputStream:</p>
<p>FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(&quot;/myfile.gz&quot;);  Add buffering:</p>
<p>BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);  Add Gzip:</p>
<p>GzipInputStream gis = new GzipInputStream(bis);  Add Serialization:</p>
<p>ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(gis);</p>
<p>So with each step we have decorated the FileInputStream with  additional behavior.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>64. What is a good scenario for using  Composite design Pattern in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the good scenarios where Composite design pattern can be  used are as follows:</p>
<p>Tree Structure: The most common use of Composite design pattern  is Tree structure. If you want to represent data in a Tree data  structure, Composite pattern can be used.</p>
<p>E.g. In an Organization, to a Manager has Employees. But Manager  is also an Employee. If we start from CEO level, there is one big  tree for the whole organization structure. Under that big tree there  are many sub-trees. This can be easily represented with Composite  design pattern.</p>
<p>Recursion: Another use of Composite design pattern is Recursion. If  we have a Recursion based algorithm, we need data to be passed to  algorithm in a data structure that treats individual objects and  compositions at each level of recursion uniformly.</p>
<p>E.g. To implement a recursive Polynomial Solving algorithm, we</p>
<p>can use Composite design pattern to store the intermediate results.</p>
<p>Graphics: Another good use of Composite design pattern is in  Graphics. We can group shapes inside a composite and make  higher-level groups of smaller groups of shapes to complete the  graphics to be displayed on screen.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>65. Have you used Singleton design  pattern in your Java project?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. Singleton is one of the most popular design patterns in  enterprise level Java applications. Almost in every project we see  some implementation of Singleton.</p>
<p>With Singleton pattern we can be sure that there is only one instance  of a class at any time in the application.</p>
<p>This helps in storing properties that have to be used in the  application in a unique location.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>66. What are the main uses of  Singleton design pattern in Java  project?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the main uses of Singleton design pattern in Java are as  follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runtime: In JDK, java.lang.Runtime is a singleton-based class. There  is only one instance of Runtime in an application. This is the only  class that interfaces with the environment/machine in which Java  process is running.</li>
<li>Enum: In Java, enum construct is also based on Singleton pattern.  Enum values can be accessed globally in same way by all classes.</li>
<li>Properties: In an application it makes sense to keep only one copy of  the properties that all classes can access. This can be achieved by  making properties class Singleton so that every class gets same copy  of properties.</li>
<li>Spring: In Spring framework, all the beans are by default Singleton  per container. So there is only one instance of bean in a Spring IoC  container. But Spring also provides options to make the scope of a  bean prototype in a container.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>67. Why java.lang.Runtime is a  Singleton in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java, java.lang.Runtime is implemented on Singleton design  pattern.</p>
<p>Runtime is the class that acts as an interface with the environment in  which Java process is running. Runtime contains methods that can  interact with the environment.</p>
<p>Like- totalmemory() method gives the total  memory in JVM.  maxMemory() method gives the maximum memory that JVM can  use.</p>
<p>There is an exit() method to exit the Java process. We do not want  multiple objects in JVM to have exit() method.</p>
<p>Similarly there is gc() method that can run the Garbage Collector.  With only one copy of gc() method, we can ensure that no other  object can run the Garbage Collector when one instance of GC is  already running.</p>
<p>Due to all these reasons there is only one copy of Runtime in Java.  To ensure single copy of Runtime, it is implemented as a Singleton  in Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>68. What is the way to implement a  thread-safe Singleton design pattern  in Java?</b></h1>
<p>In Java there are many options to implement a thread-safe Singleton  pattern. Some of these are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Double Checked Locking: This is the most popular method  to implement Singleton in Java. It is based on Lazy  Initialization. In this we first check the criteria for locking  before acquiring a lock to create an object. In Java we use  it with volatile keyword.</p>
<p>Sample code:</p>
<p>class DoubleCheckSingleton {</p>
<p>private volatile HelloSingleton helloSingleton; // Use Volatile</p>
<p>public HelloSingleton getHelloSingleton() {  HelloSingleton result = helloSingleton;</p>
<p>if (result == null) {</p>
<p>synchronized(this) { // Synchronize for thread safety  result = helloSingleton;</p>
<p>if (result == null) {</p>
<p>result = new HelloSingleton();</p>
<p>helloSingleton = result;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>return result;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill Pugh Singleton: We can also use the method by Bill  Pugh for implementing Singleton in Java. In this we use an  Inner Static class to create the Singleton instance.</li>
<p>Sample code:</p>
<p>public class SingletonBillPugh {</p>
<p>// Inner class that holds instance  private static class InnerSingleton{</p>
<p>private static final SingletonBillPugh INSTANCE = new</p>
<p>SingletonBillPugh();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>// Private constructor</p>
<p>private SingletonBillPugh(){}</p>
<p>public static SingletonBillPugh getInstance(){  return InnerSingleton.INSTANCE;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>When first time SingletonBillPugh is loaded in memory,  InnerSingleton is not loaded. Only when getInstance() method is  called, InnerSingleton class is loaded and an Instance is created.</p>
<li>Enum: We can also use Java enum to create thread-safe  implementation. Java enum values are accessible globally  so these can be used as a Singleton.</li>
<p>Sample Code:</p>
<p>public enum SingletonEnum {  INSTANCE;</p>
</ul>
<p>public static void doImplementation(){</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>69. What are the examples of  Singleton design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<p>In JDK there are many places where Singleton design pattern is  used. Some of these are as follows:</p>
<p>1.	java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime():	This	method	gives  Runtime class that has only one instance in a JVM.</p>
<p>java.lang.System.getSecurityManager():	This	method  returns a SecurityManager for the current platform.</p>
<p>java.awt.Desktop.getDesktop()</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>70. What is Template Method design  pattern in Java?</b></h1>
<p>It is a behavioral design pattern. We can use it to create an outline  for an algorithm or a complex operation. We first create the skeleton  of a program. Then we delegate the steps of the operation to  subclasses. The subclasses can redefine the inner implementation of  each step.</p>
<p>E.g. While designing a Game in Java, we can implement it as an  algorithm with Template Method pattern. Each step in the game can  be deferred to subclasses responsible for handling that step.</p>
<p>Let say we implement Monopoly game in Java. We can create  methods like initializeGame(), makeMove(), endGame() etc. Each  of these methods can be handled in subclasses in an independent  manner.</p>
<p>We can use same algorithm for Chess game with same set of  abstract methods. The subclass for Chess game can provide the  concrete implementation of methods like initializeGame(),  makeMove(), endGame() etc.</p>
<p>Template Method pattern is very useful in providing customizable  class to users. We can create the core class with a high level  implementation. And our users can customize our core class in their  custom subclasses.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>71.What are the examples of Template  method design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<p>In JDK there are many places where Template method design  pattern is used. Some of these are as follows:</p>
<p>1.	In	Java</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Collection</p>
<p>java.util.AbstractList,	java.util.AbstractSet</p>
<p>classes	like  and</p>
<p>java.util.AbstractMap	implement	a	template	for	their  corresponding Collection.</p>
<ul>
<li>javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet: In the HttpServlet class all  the doGet(), doPost() etc. methods send a HTTP 405  &quot;Method Not Allowed&quot; error to the response. This error  response is like a Template that can be further customized  for each of these methods.</li>
<li>In java.io package there are Stream and Writer classes like  java.io.InputStream, java.io.OutputStream, java.io.Reader  and java.io.Writer that provide non-abstract methods.  These methods are implementation of Template method  design pattern.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>72. Can you tell some examples of  Factory Method design pattern  implementation in Java?</b></h1>
<p>Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern. A Factory is  an object that is used to create more objects.</p>
<p>In general, a Factory object has methods that can be used to create a  type of objects. Some people call it Factory Method design pattern  as well.</p>
<p>Some of the examples of Factory Method pattern in JDK are:</p>
<p>Java.lang.Class.forName()  java.net.URLStreamHandlerFactory.createURLStreamHan  java.util.Calendar.getInstance()  java.util.ResourceBundle.getBundle()  java.text.NumberFormat.getInstance()  java.nio.charset.Charset.forName()</p>
<p>java.util.EnumSet.of()</p>
<p>javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext.createMarshaller()</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>73. What is the benefit we get by  using static factory method to create  object?</b></h1>
<p>By using Static Factory Method we encapsulate the creation process  of an object. We can use new() to create an Object from its  constructor. Instead we use static method of a Factory to create the  object. One main advantage of using Factory is that Factory can  choose the correct implementation at runtime and create the right  object. The caller of method can specify the desired behavior.</p>
<p>E.g. If we have a ShapeFactory with createShape(String type)  method. Client can call ShapeFactory.createShape(“Circle”) to get  a circular shape. ShapeFactory.createShape(“Square”) will return  square shape. In this way, ShapeFactory knows how to create  different shapes based on the input by caller.</p>
<p>Another use of Factory is in providing access to limited resources  to a large set of users.</p>
<p>E.g. In ConnectionPool, we can limit the total number of  connections that can be created as well as we can hide the  implementation details of creating connection. Here ConnectionPool  is the factory. Clients call static method  ConnectionPool.getConnection().</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>74. What are the examples of Builder  design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<p>In JDK there are many places where Builder design pattern is used.  Some of these are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>java.lang.StringBuilder.append(): StringBuilder is based  on Builder pattern.</li>
<li>java.nio.IntBuffer.put(): Invocation of put() method return  IntBuffer. Also there are many variants of this method to  build the IntBuffer.</li>
<li>javax.swing.GroupLayout.Group.addComponent(): We can  use addComponent() method to build a UI that can contain  multiple levels of components.</li>
<li>java.lang.Appendable</li>
<li>java.lang.StringBuffer.append(): StringBuffer is similar to  StringBuilder and it is also based on Builder design  pattern.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>75. What are the examples of  Abstract Factory design pattern in  JDK?</b></h1>
<p>In JDK there are many places where Abstract Factory design pattern  is used. Some of these are as follows:</p>
<p>javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory.newInstance()  javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance()  javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory.newInstance()</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>76. What are the examples of  Decorator design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<p>In JDK there are many places where Decorator design pattern is  used. Some of these are as follows:</p>
<p>1. In java.io package many classes use Decorator pattern.  Subclasses of java.io.InputStream, OutputStream, Reader  and Writer have a constructor that can take the instance of  same type and decorate it with additional behavior.</p>
<p>2.	In	java.util.Collections,</p>
<p>there	are	methods	like</p>
<p>checkedList(),</p>
<p>checkedMap(),</p>
<p>checkedCollection(),  synchronizedList(),</p>
<p>synchronizedMap(),</p>
<p>synchronizedSet(), unmodifiableSet(), unmodifiableMap()  and unmodifiableList() methods that can decorate an object  and return the same type.</p>
<p>3.	In	javax.servlet</p>
<p>javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequestWrapper</p>
<p>package,	there	are	classes	like</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>HttpServletResponseWrapper that are based on Decorator  design pattern.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>77. What are the examples of Proxy  design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<p>Proxy design pattern provides an extra level of indirection for  providing access to another object. It can also protect a real object  from any extra level of complexity.</p>
<p>In JDK there are many places where Proxy design pattern is used.  Some of these are as follows:</p>
<p>java.lang.reflect.Proxy  java.rmi.*  javax.inject.Inject  javax.ejb.EJB</p>
<p>javax.persistence.PersistenceContext</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>78. What are the examples of Chain of  Responsibility design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<h2>In JDK there are many places where Chain of Responsibility design  pattern is used. Some of these are as follows:</h2>
<ul>
<li>java.util.logging.Logger.log(): In this case Logger class  provides multiple variations of log() method that can take  the responsibility of logging from client in different  scenarios. The client has to just call the appropriate log()  method and Logger will take care of these commands.</li>
<li>javax.servlet.Filter.doFilter(): In the Filter class, the  Container calls the doFilter method when a  request/response pair is passed through the chain. With  filter the request reaches to the appropriate resource at the  end of the chain. We can pass FilterChain in doFilter()  method to allow the Filter to pass on the request and  response to the next level in the chain.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>79. What are the main uses of  Command design pattern?</b></h1>
<p>Command design pattern is a behavioral design pattern. We use it to  encapsulate all the information required to trigger an event. Some of  the main uses of Command pattern are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphic User Interface (GUI): In GUI and menu items, we  use command pattern. By clicking a button we can read the  current information of GUI and take an action.</li>
<li>Macro Recording: If each of user action is implemented as  a separate Command, we can record all the user actions in  a Macro as a series of Commands. We can use this series  to implement the “Playback” feature. In this way, Macro  can keep on doing same set of actions with each replay.</li>
<li>Multi-step Undo: When each step is recorded as a  Command, we can use it to implement Undo feature in  which each step can by undo. It is used in text editors like  MS-Word.</li>
<li>Networking: We can also send a complete Command over  the network to a remote machine where all the actions  encapsulated within a Command are executed.</li>
<li>Progress Bar: We can implement an installation routine as  a series of Commands. Each Command provides  the  estimate time. When we execute the installation routine,  with each command we can display the progress bar.</li>
<li>Wizard: In a wizard flow we can implement steps as  Commands. Each step may have complex task that is just  implemented within one command.</li>
</ul>
<p>7. Transactions: In a transactional behavior code there are  multiple tasks/updates. When all the tasks are done then  only transaction is committed. Else we have to rollback the  transaction. In such a scenario each step is implemented as  separate Command.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>80. What are the examples of  Command design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<p>In JDK there are many places where Command design pattern is  used. Some of these are as follows:</p>
<p>All implementations of java.lang.Runnable  All implementations of javax.swing.Action</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>81.What are the examples of  Interpreter design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<h2>Interpreter design pattern is used to evaluate sentences in a  language. E.g. In SQL we can use  it to evaluate a query by  evaluating each keyword like SELECT, FROM, WHERE clause.</h2>
<h2>In an Interpreter implementation there  is a class for each  keyword/symbol. A sentence is just a composite of these keywords.  But the sentence is represented by Syntax tree that can be  interpreted.</h2>
<h2>In JDK there are many places where Interpreter design pattern is  used. Some of these are as follows:</h2>
<h2>java.util.Pattern  java.text.Normalizer</h2>
<p>DateFormat,</p>
<p>Subclasses	of	java.text.Format:  MessageFormat, NumberFormat</p>
<p>Subclasses	of	javax.el.ELResolver:	ArrayELResolver,  MapELResolver, CompositeELResolver etc.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>82. What are the examples of  Mediator design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<p>By using Mediator pattern we can decouple the multiple objects that  interact with each other. With a Mediator object we can create  many-to-many relationships in multiple objects.</p>
<p>In JDK there are many places where Mediator design pattern is  used. Some of these are as follows:</p>
<p>java.util.Timer: schedule() methods in Timer class act as  Mediator between the clients and the TimerTask to be  scheduled.</p>
<p>java.util.concurrent.Executor.execute(): The execute()  method in an Executor class acts as a Mediator to execute  the different tasks.</p>
<p>java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService</p>
<p>java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(): In Method class of  reflection package, invoke() method acts as a Mediator.</p>
<p>java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService: Here also  schedule() method and its variants are Mediator pattern  implementations.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>83. What are the examples of Strategy  design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<p>In JDK there are many places where Strategy design pattern is used.  Some of these are as follows:</p>
<p>1. java.util.Comparator: In a Comparator we can use  compare() method to change the strategy used by  Collections.sort() method.</p>
<p>2.	javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet:	In</p>
<p>a	HttpServlet	class</p>
<p>service()	and	doGet(),	doPost()</p>
<p>etc.	methods	take</p>
<p>HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse and the  implementor of Servlet processes it based on the strategy it  selects.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>84. What are the examples of Visitor  design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<p>By using Visitor design pattern we can add new virtual methods to  existing classes without modifying their core structure.</p>
<p>In JDK there are many places where Visitor design pattern is used.  Some of these are as follows:</p>
<p>javax.lang.model.element.AnnotationValue	and  AnnotationValueVisitor</p>
<p>java.nio.file.FileVisitor and SimpleFileVisitor  javax.lang.model.type.TypeMirror and TypeVisitor  javax.lang.model.element.Element and ElementVisitor</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>javax.faces.component.visit.VisitContext  VisitCallback</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>85. How Decorator design pattern is  different from Proxy pattern?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between Decorator and Proxy design pattern are:</p>
<p>Decorator provides an enhanced interface after decorating  it with additional features. Proxy provides same interface  since it is just acting as a proxy to another object.</p>
<p>Decorator is a type of Composite pattern with only one  component. But each decorator can add additional  features. Since it is one component in Decorator, there is  no object aggregation.</p>
<p>Proxy can also provide performance improvement by lazy  loading. There is nothing like this available in Decorator.</p>
<p>Decorator follows recursive composition. Proxy is just  one object to another object access.</p>
<p>Decorator is mostly used for building a variety of objects.  Proxy is mainly used for access to another object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>86. What are the different scenarios  to use Setter and Constructor based  injection in Dependency Injection  (DI) design pattern?</b></h1>
<p>We use Setter injection to provide optional dependencies of an  object. Constructor injection is used to provide  mandatory  dependency of an object.</p>
<p>In Spring IoC, Dependency Injection is heavily used. There we have  to differentiate between the scenario suitable for Setter based and  Constructor based dependency injection.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>87. What are the different scenarios  for using Proxy design pattern?</b></h1>
<p>Proxy design pattern can be used in a wide variety of scenario in  Java. Some of these are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Proxy: This is a virtual object that acts as a proxy  for objects that are very expensive to create. It is used in  Lazy Loading. When client makes the first request, the real  object is created.</li>
<li>Remote Proxy: This is a local object that provides access  to a remote object. It is generally used in Remote Method  Invocation (RMI) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC). It is  also known as a Stub.</li>
<li>Protective Proxy: This is an object that control the access  to a Master object. It can authenticate and authorize the  client for accessing the Master object. If client has right  permissions, it allows client to access the main object.</li>
<li>Smart Proxy: It is an object that can add additional  information to the main object. It can track the number of  other objects accessing the main object. It can track the  different clients from where request is coming. It can even  deny access to an object if the number of requests is  greater than a threshold.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>88. What is the main difference  between Adapter and Proxy design  pattern?</b></h1>
<p>Adapter pattern provides a different interface to an object. But the  Proxy always provides same interface to the object.</p>
<p>Adapter is like providing an interface suitable to client’s use. But  Proxy is same interface that has additional feature or check.</p>
<p>E.g. In electrical appliances we use Adapter to convert from one  type of socket to another type of socket. In case of proxy, we have a  plug with built-in surge protector. The interface for plug and the  original device remains same.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>89. When will you use Adapter design  pattern in Java?</b></h1>
<p>If we have two classes with incompatible interfaces, we use  Adapter pattern to make it work. We create an Adapter object that  can adapt the interface of one class to another class.</p>
<p>It is generally used for working with third party libraries. We create  an Adapter class between third party code and our class. In case of  any change in third party code we have to just change the Adapter  code. Rest of our code can remain same and just take to Adapter.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>90. What are the examples of Adapter  design pattern in JDK?</b></h1>
<p>In JDK there are many places where Adapter design pattern is used.  Some of these are as follows:</p>
<p>java.util.Arrays.asList(): This method can adapt an Array  to work as a List.</p>
<p>java.util.Collections.list(): This method can adapt any  collection to provide List behavior.</p>
<p>java.util.Collections.enumeration(): This method returns  an enumeration over the collection.</p>
<p>java.io.InputStreamReader(InputStream):	This	method  adapts a Stream to Reader class.</p>
<p>java.io.OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream): This method  adapts an OutputStream to Writer class.</p>
<p>javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlAdapter.marshal()</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>91.What is the difference between  Factory and Abstract Factory design  pattern?</b></h1>
<h2>With Factory design pattern we can create concrete products of a  type that Factory can manufacture. E.g. If it is CarFactory, we can  produce, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Maserati etc.</h2>
<h2>With Abstract Factory design pattern we create a concrete  implementation of a Factory. E.g. DeviceFactory can be Abstract  and it can give us GoogleDeviceFactory, AppleDeviceFactory etc.  With AppleDeviceFactory we will get products like- iPhone, iPad,  Mac etc. With GoogleDeviceFactory we will get products like-  Nexus phone, Google Nexus tablet, Google ChromeBook etc.</h2>
<h2>So it is a subtle difference between Factory and Abstract Factory  design pattern. One way to remember is that within Abstract Factory  pattern, Factory pattern is already implemented.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>92. What is Open/closed design  principle in Software engineering?</b></h1>
<p>Open/closed design principle states “software entities (classes,  modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed  for modification”.</p>
<p>Open/closed principle term was originated by Bertrand Meyer in  his book Object Oriented Software Construction.</p>
<p>As per this principle, if a module is available for extension then it  is considered open. If a module is available for use by other  modules then it is considered closed.</p>
<p>Further Robert C. Martin has mentioned it as O in SOLID principles  of Object Oriented design.</p>
<p>It is used in State and Strategy design patterns. Context class is  closed for modification. But new functionality can be added by  writing new strategy code.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>93. What is SOLID design principle?</b></h1>
<p>SOLID word in SOLID design principle is an acronym for:</p>
<ul>
<li>S: Single responsibility. A Class should have a single  responsibility.</li>
<li>O: Open-closed. Software entities should be open for</li>
<p>extension but closed for modification.</p>
<li>L: Liskov substitution. Objects in a program should be  replaceable by subclasses of same type without  any  adverse impact.</li>
<li>I: Interface segregation. Multiple client specific interfaces</li>
<p>are preferable over single generic interface.</p>
<li>D: Dependency inversion. Program should depend on  abstract entities. It should not depend on concrete  implementation of an interface.</li>
<p>This principle was mentioned by Robert C. Martin. These are  considered five basic principles of Object Oriented design.</p>
<p>If we follow these principles, then we can create a stable program  that is easy to maintain and can be extended over time.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>94. What is Builder design pattern?</b></h1>
<p>Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern. We can use  Builder pattern to create complex objects with multiple options.</p>
<p>E.g. when we have to create a Meal in a restaurant we can use  Builder pattern. We can keep adding options like- Starter, Drink,  Main Course, and Dessert etc. to create complete meal. When a user  selects other options of Starter, Drink Main Course, Dessert another  type of meal is created.</p>
<p>Main feature of Builder pattern is step-by-step building of a  complex object with multiple options.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>95. What are the different categories  of Design Patterns used in Object  Oriented Design?</b></h1>
<p>In Object Oriented design mainly three categories of design patterns  are used. These categories are:</p>
<p>Creational Design Patterns:  Builder</p>
<p>Factory Method</p>
<p>Abstract Factory  Object Pool  Singleton  Prototype</p>
<p>Structural Design Patterns:  Adapter</p>
<p>Bridge</p>
<p>Façade  Decorator  Composite  Flyweight  Proxy</p>
<p>Behavioral Design Patterns:  Command</p>
<p>Iterator</p>
<p>Chain of Responsibility  Observer</p>
<p>State</p>
<p>Strategy  Mediator  Interpreter</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>96. What is the design pattern  suitable to access elements of a  Collection?</b></h1>
<p>We can use Iterator design pattern to access the individual elements  of a Collection. In case of an ordered collection we can get Iterator  that returns the elements in an order.</p>
<p>In Java there are many implementation of Iterator in Collections  package. We have iterators like- Spliterator, ListIterator etc. that  implement Iterator pattern.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>97. How can we implement Producer  Consumer design pattern in Java?</b></h1>
<p>We	can	use	BlockingQueue	in	Java	to	implement	Producer  Consumer design pattern.</p>
<p>It is a concurrent design pattern.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>98. What design pattern is suitable to  add new features to an existing  object?</b></h1>
<p>We can use Decorator design pattern to add new features to an  existing object. With a Decorator we work on same object and  return the same object with more features. But the structure of the  object remains same since all the decorated versions of object  implement same interface.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>99. Which design pattern can be used  when to decouple abstraction from the  implementation?</b></h1>
<p>We can use Bridge design pattern to detach the implementation from  the abstraction.</p>
<p>Bridge is mainly used for separation of concern in design. We can  create an implementation and store it in the interface, which is an  abstraction. Where as specific implementation of other features can  be done in concrete classes that implement the interface.</p>
<p>Often Bridge design pattern is implemented by using Adapter  pattern.</p>
<p>E.g. we have Shape interface. We want to make Square and Circle  shapes. But further we want to make RedSquare, BlackSquare  shapes and GreenCircle, WhiteCircle shapes. In this case rather  than creating one hierarchy of all the shapes, we separate the Color  concern from Shape hierarchy.</p>
<p>So we create two hierarchies. One is Shape to Square and Shape to  Circle hierarchy. Another one is Color to Red, Black, Green, White  hierarchy. In this way we can create multiple types of shapes with  multiple colors with Bridge design pattern.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>100.Which is the design pattern used  in Android applications?</b></h1>
<p>Android applications predominantly use Model View Presenter  design pattern.</p>
<ul>
<li>Model: This  is the domain model of the Android  application. It contains the business logic and business  rules.</li>
<li>View: These are the UI components in your application.  These are part of the view. Also any events  on UI  components are part of view module.</li>
<li>Presenter: This is the bridge between Model and View to  control the communication. Presenter can query the model  and return data to view to update it.</li>
<li>E.g. If we have a Model with large news article data, and  view needs only headline, then presenter can query the  data from model and only give headline to view. In this  way view remains very light in this design pattern.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>101. How can we prevent users from  creating more than one instance of  singleton object by using clone()  method?</b></h1>
<p>First we should not implement the Cloneable interface by the object  that is a Singleton.</p>
<p>Second, if we have to implement Cloneable interface then we can  throw exception in clone() method.</p>
<p>This will ensure that no one can use clone() method or Cloneable  interface to create more than one instance of Singleton object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>102.What is the use of Interceptor  design pattern?</b></h1>
<h2>Interceptor design pattern is used for intercepting a request. Primary  use of this pattern is in Security policy implementation.</h2>
<h2>We can use this pattern to intercept the requests by a client to a  resource. At the interception we can check for authentication and  authorization of client for the resource being accessed.</h2>
<h2>In Java it is used in javax.servlet.Filter interface.</h2>
<h2>This pattern is also used in Spring framework in HandlerInterceptor  and MVC interceptor.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>103.What are the Architectural  patterns that you have used?</b></h1>
<p>Architectural patterns  are used to define the architecture of a  Software system. Some of the patterns are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>MVC: Model View Controller. This pattern is extensively  used in the architecture of Spring framework.</li>
<li>Publish-subscribe: This pattern is the basis of messaging  architecture. In this case messages are published to a  Topic. And subscribers subscribe to the topic of their  interests. Once the message is published to a topic in  which a Subscriber has an interest, the message is  consumed by the relevant subscriber.</li>
<li>Service Locator: This design pattern is used in a service  like JNDI to locate the available services. It uses as  central registry to maintain the list of services.</li>
<li>n-Tier: This is a generic design pattern to divide the  architecture in multiple tiers. E.g. there is 3-tier  architecture with Presentation layer, Application layer and  Data access layer. It is also called multi-layer design  pattern.</li>
<li>Data Access Object (DAO): This pattern is used in  providing access to database objects. The underlying  principle is that we can change the underlying database  system, without  changing the business logic. Since  business logic talks to DAO object, there is no impact of  changing Database system on business logic.</li>
<li>Inversion of Control (IoC): This is the core of Dependency  Injection in Spring framework. We use this design pattern</li>
</ul>
<p>to increase the modularity of an application. We keep the  objects loosely coupled with Dependency Injection.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>104.	What are the popular uses of  Façade design pattern?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the popular uses of Façade design pattern are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Façade provides convenient methods for common tasks  that are used more often.</li>
<li>A Façade can make the software library more readable.</li>
<li>A Façade can reduce the external dependencies on the  working of inner code.</li>
<li>A Façade can act as a single well-designed API by</li>
<p>wrapping a collection of poorly designed APIs.</p>
<li>A Façade pattern can be used when a System is very  complex and difficult to use. It can simplify the usage of  complex system.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>105.What is the difference between  Builder design pattern and Factory  design pattern?</b></h1>
<p>Both Factory and Builder patterns are creational design patterns.  They are similar in nature but Factory pattern is a simplified generic  version of Builder pattern.</p>
<p>We use Factory pattern to create different concrete subtypes of an  Object. The client of a Factory may not know the exact subtype. E.g.  If we call createDrink() of a Factory, we may get Tea or Coffee  drinks.</p>
<p>We can also use Builder pattern to create different concrete  subtypes of an object. But in the Builder pattern the composition of  the object can be more complex. E.g. If we call createDrink() for  Builder, we can getCappuccino Coffee with Vanilla Cream and  Sugar, or we can get Latte Coffee with Splenda and milk cream.</p>
<p>So a Builder can support creation of a large number of variants of  an object. But a Factory can create a broader range of known  subtypes of an object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>106.What is Memento design  pattern?</b></h1>
<p>Memento design pattern is used to implement rollback  feature in an object. In a Memento pattern there are three  objects:</p>
<p>Originator: This is the object that has an internal state.</p>
<p>Caretaker: This is the object that can change the state of  Originator. But it wants to have control over rolling back  the change.</p>
<p>Memento: This is the object that Caretaker gets from  Originator, before making and change. If Caretaker wants  to Rollback the change it gives Memento back to  Originator. Originator can use Memento to restore its own  state to the original state.</p>
<p>E.g. One good use of memento is in online Forms. If we  want to show to user a form pre-populated with some  data, we keep this copy in memento. Now user can  update the form. But at any time when user wants to reset  the form, we use memento to make the form in its original  pre-populated state. If user wants to just save the form  we save the form and update the memento. Now onwards  any new changes to the form can be rolled back to the  last saved Memento object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>107.What is an AntiPattern?</b></h1>
<p>An AntiPattern is opposite of a Design Pattern. It is a common  practice in an organization that is used to deal with a recurring  problem but it has more bad consequences than good ones.</p>
<p>AntiPattern can be found in an Organization, Architecture or  Software Engineering.</p>
<p>Some of the AntiPatterns in Software Engineering are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold Plating: Keep on adding extra things on a working  solution even though these extra things do not add any  additional value.</li>
<li>Spaghetti Code: Program that are written in a very  complex way and are hard to understand due to misuse of  data structures.</li>
<li>Coding By Exception: Adding new code just to handle  exception cases and corner case scenarios.</li>
<li>Copy Paste Programming: Just copying the same code  multiple times rather than writing generic code that can be  parameterized.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>108.What is a Data Access Object  (DAO) design pattern?</b></h1>
<p>DAO design pattern is used in the data persistent layer of a Java  application. It mainly uses OOPS principle of Encapsulation.</p>
<p>By using DAO pattern it makes the application loosely coupled and  less dependent on actual database.</p>
<p>We can even implement some in-memory database like H2 with  DAO to handle the unit-testing.</p>
<p>In short, DAO hides the underlying database implementation from  the class that accesses the data via DAO object.</p>
<p>Recently we can combine DAO with Spring framework to inject any  DB implementation.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Spring</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>109.What is Spring framework?</b></h1>
<p>Spring is development framework for Java programming. It is an  open source development framework for Enterprise Java.</p>
<p>The core features of Spring Framework can be used in developing a  Java Enterprise application.</p>
<p>It has many extensions and jars for developing web applications on  top of Java EE platform.</p>
<p>With Spring we can develop large-scale complex Java applications  very easily. It is also based on good design patterns like  Dependency Injection, Aspect oriented programming for developing  extensible feature rich software.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>110. What are the benefits of Spring  framework in software development?</b></h1>
<p>Many benefits of Spring framework are:</p>
<p>Lightweight Framework: Basic Spring framework is very small in  size. It is easy to use and does not add a lot of overhead on  software. It just has 2 MB in basic version.</p>
<p>Container: Spring framework provides the basic container that  creates and manages the life cycle of application objects like Plain  old Java objects (POJO). It also stores the configuration files of  application objects to be created.</p>
<p>Dependency Injection (DI): Spring provided loose coupling is  application by Dependency Injection. It uses Inversion of Control  technique by which objects specify their dependencies to Spring  container instead of creating new objects themselves.</p>
<p>Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP): Spring framework promotes  and provides support for Aspect oriented programming in Java.  This helps in separating application business logic from system  services that are common across all the business logic. E.g. Logging  can be a cross cutting concern in an Application.</p>
<p>Transaction Management: Spring provides  a framework for  transaction management. So a developer does not have to implement  it from scratch. Spring Transaction Management is so powerful that  we can scale it from one local transaction to global transactions in a  cluster.</p>
<p>MVC Framework: For Web applications, Spring provides MVC  framework. This framework is based on MVC design pattern and</p>
<p>has better features compared to other web frameworks.</p>
<p>Exception Handling: Spring also gives support for a common API to  handle exceptions in various technologies like- Hibernate, JDBC  etc.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>116. What is the use of BeanFactory in  Spring framework?</b></h1>
<p>BeanFactory is the main class that helps in implementing Inversion  of Control pattern in Spring. It is based on the factory design  pattern. It separates the configuration and dependencies of an  application from the rest of application code.</p>
<p>Implementations of BeanFactory like XmlBeanFactory class are  used by applications built with Spring.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>117. Which is the most popular  implementation of BeanFactory in  Spring?</b></h1>
<p>XMLBeanFactory	is	the	most	popular	implementation	of  BeanFactory in Spring.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>118.What is XMLBeanFactory in  Spring framework?</b></h1>
<p>XMLBeanFactory is one of the most useful implementation of  BeanFactory in Spring. This factory loads its beans based on the  definitions mentioned in an XML file.</p>
<p>Spring container reads bean configuration metadata from an XML  file and creates a fully configured application with the help of  XMLBeanFactory class.</p>

<p>Allows developers to declaratively bind request parameters to  business objects</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>124.	What is the purpose of Spring</b></h1>
<p><b>configuration file?</b></p>
<p>Spring application can be configured by an XML file. This file  contains information of classes and how these classes are  configured and introduced to each other.</p>
<p>Spring IoC container uses some kind of configuration metadata. This  configuration metadata represents how an application developer  tells the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and assemble the  objects in your application. This configuration metadata is stored in  Spring configuration file.</p>
<p>The other ways of specifying configuration metadata are Java based  configuration and Annotation based configuration.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>125.What is the purpose of Spring  IoC container?</b></h1>
<p>The Spring IoC Container is responsible for:</p>
<p>Creating the objects  Configuring the objects</p>
<p>Managing dependency between objects (with dependency injection</p>
<p>(DI))</p>
<p>Wiring the objects together</p>
<p>Managing complete lifecycle of objects</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>126.What is the main benefit of  Inversion of Control (IOC) principle?</b></h1>
<p>Inversion of Control (IOC) principle is the base of Spring  framework. It supports dependency injection in an application. With  Dependency Injection, a programmer has to write minimal code. It  also makes easier to test an application.</p>
<p>Most important benefit is that it leads to loose coupling within  objects. With loose coupling it is easier to change the application  with new requirements.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>127.Does IOC containers support  Eager Instantiation or Lazy loading of  beans?</b></h1>
<p>IOC Container in Spring supports both the approaches. Eager  instantiation as well as lazy loading of beans.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>128.	What are the benefits of  ApplicationContext in Spring?</b></h1>
<h2>ApplicationContext in Spring provides following benefits:</h2>
<h2>Bean  factory  methods:	These	are	used	to	access	application  components</h2>
<h2>Load File Resources: It helps in loading file resources in a generic</h2>
<h2>fashion</h2>
<h2>Publish Events: It enables publishing events to registered listeners  Internationalization Support: Ability to resolve messages to support  internationalization</h2>
<h2>Parent Context: Ability to inherit from a parent context</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>129.How will you implement  ApplicationContext in Spring  framework?</b></h1>
<p>ApplicationContext in Spring can be implemented in one of the  following three ways:</p>
<p>FileSystemXmlApplicationContext: If we want to load the  definitions of beans from an XML file then  FileSystemXmlApplicationContext is used. The full path of XML  bean configuration file is provided to the constructor.</p>
<p>ClassPathXmlApplicationContext: To loads the definitions of beans</p>
<p>from an XML file in the CLASSPATH, we use  ClassPathXmlApplicationContext. It is used for application context  embedded in jars.</p>
<p>WebXmlApplicationContext: To provide configuration for a web  application WebXmlApplicationContext is used. While the  application is running, it is read only. But it can be reloaded if  underlying application supports it.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>130.Explain the difference between  ApplicationContext and BeanFactory  in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between ApplicationContext and BeanFactory are:</p>
<p>Automatic BeanPostProcessor registration: BeanFactory does not  support	BeanPostProcessor	registration.	Whereas  ApplicationContext support this.</p>
<p>Automatic BeanFactoryPostProcessor registration: BeanFactory  also does not allow Automatic BeanFactoryPostProcessor  registration. Whereas ApplicationContext allows this.</p>
<p>MessageSource access: BeanFactory is not convenient for  MessageSource access. ApplicationContext is quite convenient for  MessageSource access.</p>
<p>ApplicationEvent: We cannot publish ApplicationEvent with  BeanFactory. But ApplicationContext provides ability to publish  ApplicationEvent.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>131. Between ApplicationContext and  BeanFactory which one is preferable  to use in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>Spring documentation recommends using ApplicationContext  in  almost all the cases. ApplicationContext has all the functionality of  BeanFactory.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>132.What are the main components of  a typical Spring based application?</b></h1>
<p>In a Spring based application, main components are:</p>
<p>Spring configuration XML file: This is used to configure Spring  application</p>
<p>API Interfaces: Definition of API interfaces for functions provided</p>
<p>by application</p>
<p>Implementation: Application code with implementation of APIs  Aspects: Spring Aspects implemented by application</p>
<p>Client: Application at client side that is used for accessing functions</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>133.Explain Dependency Injection  (DI) concept in Spring framework?</b></h1>
<p>Dependency Injection is a software design pattern. It is used to  implement Inversion of Control (IOC) in Spring framework. As per  this pattern, we do not create objects in an application by calling  new. Rather, we describe how an object should be created. In this  way creation of an object is not tightly coupled with another object.</p>
<p>A container is responsible for creating and wiring the objects. The  container can call injecting code and wire the objects as per the  configuration at runtime.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>134.	What are the different roles in  Dependency Injection (DI)?</b></h1>
<p>There are four roles in Dependency Injection:</p>
<p>Service object(s) to be used</p>
<p>Client object that depends on the service  Interface that defines how client uses services</p>
<p>Injector responsible for constructing services and injecting them</p>
<p>into client</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>135.Spring framework provides what  kinds of Dependency Injection  mechanism?</b></h1>
<h2>Spring framework provides two types of Dependency Injection  mechanism:</h2>
<h2>Constructor-based Dependency Injection: Spring container can  invoke a class constructor with a number of arguments. This  represents a dependency on other class.</h2>
<h2>Setter-based Dependency Injection: Spring container can call setter  method on a bean after creating it with a no-argument constructor or  no-argument static factory method to instantiate another bean.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>136.In Spring framework, which  Dependency Injection is better?  Constructor-based DI or Setter-based  DI?</b></h1>
<p>Spring framework provides support for both Constructor-based and  Setter-based Dependency Injection. There are different scenarios in  which these options can be used.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use Constructor-based DI for mandatory  dependencies. Whereas Setter-based DI  is used for optional  dependencies.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>137.What are the advantages of  Dependency Injection (DI)?</b></h1>
<p>Dependency Injection (DI) pattern has following advantages:</p>
<p>Dependency Injection reduces coupling between a class and its  dependencies.</p>
<p>With Dependency  Injection (DI), we can do concurrent  or  independent software development. Two teams can work parallel  on classes that will be used by each other.</p>
<p>In Dependency Injection (DI), the client can be configured in  multiple ways. It needs to just work with the given interface. Rest of  the implementation can be changed and configured for different  features.</p>
<p>Dependency injection is also used to export a system's configuration  details into configuration files. So we can configure same  application  run  in different  environments  based  on configuration.</p>
<p>E.g.  Run  in  Test  environment,  UAT   environment,  and Production</p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p>Dependency Injection (DI) applications provide more ease and  flexibility of testing. These can be tested in isolation in Unit Test.</p>
<p>Dependency injection (DI) isolates client from the impact of design  and implementation changes. Therefore, it promotes reusability,  testability and maintainability.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>138.What are the disadvantages of  Dependency Injection (DI)?</b></h1>
<h2>Dependency Injection (DI) pattern has following disadvantages:</h2>
<h2>Most of the time Dependency Injection forces developers to use an  injection framework like Spring. This causes dependency on a  framework.</h2>
<h2>With Dependency Injection, clients are dependent on the  configuration data. This becomes extra task for developers when the  application does not need so many custom configuration values.</h2>
<h2>Code is difficult to trace and read in Dependency Injection. DI  separates behavior from construction of objects.</h2>
<h2>Dependency injection increases complexity in the linkages between  classes. It may become harder to manage such complexity outside  the implementation of a class.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>139.What is a Spring Bean?</b></h1>
<p>A Spring Bean is a plain old Java object (POJO) that is created and  managed by a Spring container.</p>
<p>There can be more than one bean in a Spring application. But all  these Beans are instantiated and assembled by Spring container.</p>
<p>Developer provides configuration metadata to Spring container for  creating and managing the lifecycle of Spring Bean.</p>
<p>In general a Spring Bean is singleton. Evert bean has an attribute  named &quot;singleton&quot;. If its value is true then bean is a singleton. If its  value is false then bean is a prototype bean.</p>
<p>By default the value of this attribute is true. Therefore, by default all  the beans in spring framework are singleton in nature.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>140.	What does the definition of a  Spring Bean contain?</b></h1>
<p>A Spring Bean definition contains configuration metadata for bean.  This configuration metadata is used by Spring container to:</p>
<p>Create the bean  Manage its lifecycle</p>
<p>Resolve its dependencies</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>141.What are the different ways to  provide configuration metadata to a  Spring Container?</b></h1>
<h2>Spring supports three ways to provide configuration metadata to  Spring Container:</h2>
<h2>XML based configuration: We can specify configuration data in an  XML file.</h2>
<h2>Annotation-based configuration: We can use Annotations to specify  configuration. This was introduced in Spring 2.5.</h2>
<h2>Java-based configuration: This is introduced from Spring 3.0. We  can embed annotations like @Bean, @Import, @Configuration in  Java code to specify configuration metadata.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>142.	What are the different scopes</b></h1>
<p><b>of a Bean supported by Spring?</b></p>
<p>Spring framework support seven types of scopes for a Bean. Out of  these only five scopes are available for a web-aware  ApplicationContext application:</p>
<p>singleton: This is the default scope of a bean. Under this scope,  there is a single object instance of bean per Spring IoC container.</p>
<p>prototype: Under this scope a single bean definition can have  multiple object instances.</p>
<p>request: In this scope, a single bean definition remains tied to the  lifecycle of a single HTTP request. Each HTTP request will have  its own instance of a bean for a single bean definition. It is only  valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.</p>
<p>session: Under this scope, a single bean definition is tied to the  lifecycle of an HTTP Session. Each HTTP Session will have one  instance of bean. It is also valid in the context of a web-aware  Spring ApplicationContext.</p>
<p>globalSession: This scope, ties a single bean definition to the  lifecycle of a global HTTP Session. It is generally valid in a Portlet  context. It is also valid in the context of a web-aware Spring  ApplicationContext.</p>
<p>application: This scope, limits a single bean definition to the  lifecycle of a ServletContext. It is also valid in the context of a  web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.</p>
<p>websocket: In this scope, a single bean definition is tied to the  lifecycle of a WebSocket. It is also valid in the context of a web-  aware Spring ApplicationContext.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>143.	How will you define the scope  of a bean in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>In configuration xml, we can specify the scope of bean in its  definition. This is used by container to decide the scope of bean in  Spring.</p>
<p>E.g. &lt;bean id=&quot;userService&quot; class=&quot;com.um.UserService&quot;  scope=&quot;prototype&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>This is an example of userService bean with prototype scope.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>144.	Is it safe to assume that a  Singleton bean is thread safe in Spring  Framework?</b></h1>
<p>No, Spring framework does not guarantee anything related to multi-  threaded behavior of a singleton bean. Developer is responsible for  dealing with concurrency issues and maintaining thread safety of a  singleton bean.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>145.	What are the design-patterns  used in Spring framework?</b></h1>
<p>Spring framework uses many Design patterns. Some of these  patterns are:</p>
<p>Singleton – By default beans defined in spring config files are  singleton. These are based on Singleton pattern.</p>
<p>Template – This pattern is used in many classes like-  JdbcTemplate, RestTemplate, JmsTemplate, JpaTemplate etc.</p>
<p>Dependency Injection – This pattern is the core behind the design of  BeanFactory and ApplicationContext.</p>
<p>Proxy – Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) heavily uses proxy  design pattern.</p>
<p>Front Controller – DispatcherServlet in Spring is based on Front  Controller pattern to ensure that incoming requests are dispatched to  other controllers.</p>
<p>Factory pattern – To create an instance of an object, BeanFactory is  used. This is based on Factory pattern.</p>
<p>View Helper – Spring has multiple options to separating core code  from presentation in views. Like- Custom JSP tags, Velocity macros  etc.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>146.	What is the lifecycle of a Bean  in Spring framework?</b></h1>
<p>A Bean in Spring framework goes through following phases in its  lifecycle.</p>
<p>Initialization and creation: Spring container gets the definition of  Bean from XML file and instantiates the Bean. It populates all the  properties of Bean as mentioned in the bean definition.</p>
<p>Setting the Behavior of Bean: In case a Bean implements  BeanNameAware interface, Spring uses setBeanName() method to  pass the bean’s id. In case a Bean implements BeanFactoryAware  interface, Spring uses setBeanFactory() to pass the BeanFactory to  bean.</p>
<p>Post	Processing:	Spring</p>
<p>postProcesserBeforeInitialization()</p>
<p>container  method</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>BeanPostProcessors	associated	with	the</p>
<p>bean.	Spring</p>
<p>uses  call  calls</p>
<p>afterPropertySet() method to call the specific initialization methods.</p>
<p>In	case	there	are	any	BeanPostProcessors	of	a</p>
<p>bean,	the</p>
<p>postProcessAfterInitialization() method is called.</p>
<p>Destruction: During the destruction of a bean, if bean implements  DisposableBean, Spring calls destroy() method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>147.	What are the two main groups  of methods in a Bean’s lifecycle?</b></h1>
<h2>A Bean in Spring has two main groups of lifecycle methods.</h2>
<h2>Initialization Callbacks: Once all the necessary properties of a Bean  are set by the container, Initialization Callback methods are used for  performing initialization work. A developer can implement method  afterPropertiesSet() for this work.</h2>
<h2>Destruction Callbacks: When the Container of a Bean is destroyed,  it calls the methods in DisposableBean to do any cleanup work.  There is a method called destroy() that can be used for this purpose  to make Destruction Callbacks.</h2>
<h2>Recent recommendation from Spring is to not use these methods,  since it can strongly couple your code to Spring code.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>148.	Can we override main lifecycle  methods of a Bean in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, Spring framework allows developers to override the lifecycle  methods of a Bean. This is used for writing any custom behavior for  Bean.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>149.	What are Inner beans in  Spring?</b></h1>
<p>A bean that is used as a property of another bean is known as Inner  bean. It can be defined as a &lt;bean/&gt; element in &lt;property/&gt; or</p>
<p>&lt;constructor-arg/&gt; tags.</p>
<p>It is not mandatory for an Inner bean to have id or a name. These are  always anonymous.</p>
<p>Inner bean does not need a scope. By default it is of prototype  scope.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>150. How can we inject a Java  Collection in Spring framework?</b></h1>
<p>Spring promotes Dependency Injection (DI) in code. It gives  support for injecting not only objects but also collection of objects.</p>
<p>We can inject collections like- list, set, map etc. in Spring.  Following tags can be used for this purpose:</p>
<p>&lt;list&gt; : This type is used for injecting a list of values. In a &lt;list&gt;  duplicates are allowed.</p>
<p>&lt;set&gt; : This type is used for injecting a set of values. As per set  property, duplicates are not allowed.</p>
<p>&lt;map&gt; : This type is used for injecting name-value pairs in form of  map. Name and value can be of any type that is allowed for a map.</p>
<p>&lt;props&gt; : This type is used to inject a collection of String based  name-value. It is like a properties file.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>151.What is Bean wiring in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>A Spring container is responsible for injecting dependencies  between beans. This process of connecting beans is called wiring.</p>
<p>Developer mentions in configuration file, the dependencies between  beans. And Spring container reads these dependencies and wires  the beans on creation.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>152.What is Autowiring in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>Autowiring is a feature of Spring in which container can  automatically wire/connect the beans by reading the configuration  file.</p>
<p>Developer has to just define “autowire” attribute in a bean.</p>
<p>Spring resolves the dependencies automatically by looking at this  attribute of beans that are autowired.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>153.What are the different modes of  Autowiring supported by Spring?</b></h1>
<p>There are five modes of Autowiring supported by Spring  framework:</p>
<p>no: This is default setting for Autowiring. In this case, we use “ref”  mode to mention the explicit bean that is being referred for wiring.</p>
<p>E.g. In this example Employee bean refers Manager bean.</p>
<p>&lt;bean id=&quot;employee&quot; class=&quot;com.dept.Employee&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;property name=&quot;manager&quot; ref=&quot;manager&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/bean&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;bean id=&quot;manager&quot; class=&quot;com.dept.Manager&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>byName: In this case, Spring container tries to match beans by name  during Autowiring. If the name of a bean is same as the name of  bean referred in autowire byname, then it automatically wires it.</p>
<p>E.g. In following example, Manager bean is wired to Employee  bean by Name.</p>
<p>&lt;bean	id=&quot;employee&quot;	class=&quot;com.dept.Employee&quot;  autowire=&quot;byName&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;bean id=&quot;manager&quot; class=&quot;com.dept.Manager&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>byType: In this case, Spring container check the properties of beans  referred with attribute byType. Then it matches the type of bean and  wires. If it finds more than one such bean of that type, it throws a  fatal exception.</p>
<p>E.g. In following example, Manager bean is wired by type to</p>
<p>Employee bean.</p>
<p>&lt;bean	id=&quot;employee&quot;</p>
<p>class=&quot;com.dept.Employee&quot;</p>
<p>autowire=&quot;byType&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;bean id=&quot;manager&quot; class=&quot;com.dept.Manager&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>constructor: In this case, Spring container looks for byType attribute  in constructor argument. It tries to find the bean with exact name. If  it finds more than one bean of same name, it throws fatal exception.  This case is similar to byType case.</p>
<p>E.g.	In	following	example	“constructor”	mode	is	used	for  autowiring.</p>
<p>&lt;bean	id=&quot;employee&quot;	class=&quot;com.dept.Employee&quot;</p>
<p>autowire=&quot;constructor&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;bean id=&quot;manager&quot; class=&quot;com.dept.Manager&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>autodetect: This is an advanced mode for autowiring. In this case,  by default Spring tries to find a constructor match. If it does not find  constructor then it uses autowire by Type.</p>
<p>E.g. This is an example of autodetect Autowiring.</p>
<p>&lt;bean	id=&quot;employee&quot;	class=&quot;com.dept.Employee&quot;  autowire=&quot;autodetect&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;bean id=&quot;manager&quot; class=&quot;com.dept.Manager&quot; /&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>154. What are the cases in which  Autowiring may not work in Spring  framework?</b></h1>
<p>Autowiring is a great feature in Spring. It can be used in most of the  cases. But there are certain scenarios in which Autowiring may not  work.</p>
<p>Explicit wiring: Since Autowiring is done by Spring, developer  does not have full control on specifying the exact class to be used. It  is preferable to use Explicit wiring in case of full control over  wiring.</p>
<p>Primitive Data types: Autowiring does not allow wiring of  properties that are based on primitive data types like- int, float etc.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>155.Is it allowed to inject null or  empty String values in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, Spring allows injecting null or empty String values.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>156.What is a Java-based  Configuration in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>Spring allows for Java-based configuration in which a developer  can specify configuration by using Java-based annotations. This  feature was introduced in Spring 3.0.</p>
<p>You can use annotations like- @Configuration, @Bean, @Import  and @DependsOn in Java classes for specifying the configuration.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>157.What is the purpose of  @Configuration annotation?</b></h1>
<p>This annotation is used in a class to indicate that this is class is the  primary source of bean definitions. This class can also contain  inter-bean dependencies that are annotated by @Bean annotation.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>158.	What is the difference between  Full @Configuration and 'lite'  @Beans mode?</b></h1>
<h2>Spring allows for using @Bean annotation on methods that are  declared in classes not annotated with @Configuration. This is  known as “lite” mode. In this mode, bean methods can be declared  in a @Component or a plain java class without any annotation.</h2>
<h2>In the “lite” mode, @Bean methods cannot declare inter-bean  dependencies.</h2>
<h2>It is recommended that one @Bean method should not invoke  another @Bean method in 'lite' mode.</h2>
<h2>Spring recommends that @Bean methods declared within  @Configuration classes should be used for full configuration. This  kind of full mode can prevent many bugs.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>159.In Spring framework, what is  Annotation-based container  configuration?</b></h1>
<h2>From Spring 2.5 version it is possible to provide configuration by  using annotation.</h2>
<h2>To	turn	this	configuration	on,	we	need	to	mention</h2>
<h2>&lt;context:annotation-config/&gt; in spring XML file.</h2>
<h2>Now developer can use annotations like @Required, @Autowired,  @Qualifier etc. in a class file to specify the configuration for beans.  Spring container can use this information from annotation for  creating and wiring the beans.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>160.How will you switch on  Annotation based wiring in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>To use Annotation based wiring, we need to turn on Annotation  based configuration in Spring.</p>
<p>By default, Annotation based configuration is switched off in  Spring. To turn it is we can specify &lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;  element in Spring config file.</p>
<p>Once it is turned on, we can use  @Autowired annotation or  @Required annotation in a Java class for wiring in Spring.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>161. What is @Autowired annotation?</b></h1>
<p>We can use @Autowired annotation to auto wire a bean on a setter  method, constructor or a field. @Autowired auto wiring is done by  matching the data type.</p>
<p>Before using @Autowired annotation we have to register  AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor. This  can be done by  including &lt;context:annotation-config /&gt; in bean configuration file.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>162.What is @Required annotation?</b></h1>
<p>We use @Required annotation to a property to check whether the  property has been set or not.</p>
<p>Spring	container	throws	BeanInitializationException	if	the  @Required annotated property is not set.</p>
<p>When	we	use	@Required	annotation,	we	have	to	register  RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor in Spring config file.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>163.What are the two ways to enable  RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcesso  in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor can be enabled in two ways  in Spring:</p>
<p>Include &lt;context:annotation-config /&gt;</p>
<p>Add Spring context and &lt;context:annotation-config /&gt; in bean  configuration file.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>

<p>&lt;/beans&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>164.	What is @Qualifier annotation  in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>We use @Qualifier annotation to mark a bean as ready for auto  wiring. This annotation is used along with @Autowired annotation  to specify the exact bean for auto wiring by Spring container.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>165.How Spring framework makes  JDBC coding easier for developers?</b></h1>
<p>Spring provides a mature JDBC framework to provide support for  JDBC coding. Spring JDBC handled resource management as well  as error handling in a generic way. This reduces the work of  software developers.</p>
<p>They just have to write queries and related statements to fetch the  data or to store the data in database.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>166.What is the purpose of  JdbcTemplate?</b></h1>
<p>Spring framework provides JdbcTemplate class that contains many  convenient methods for regular tasks like- converting data into  primitives or objects, executing prepared or callable statements etc.</p>
<p>This class makes it very easy to work with database in our  Application and it also provides good support for custom error  handling in database access code.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>167.What are the benefits of using  Spring DAO?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the benefits of using Spring DAO are:</p>
<p>It makes it easier to work on different data access methods like-  JDBC, Hibernate etc.</p>
<p>It provides a consistent and common way to deal with different data</p>
<p>access methods.</p>
<p>Spring DAO makes it easier to switch between different data  persistence frameworks.</p>
<p>No need for catching framework specific exceptions.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>168.What are the different ways to  use Hibernate in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>Spring provides two ways to use Hibernate:</p>
<p>We	can	extend	HibernateDAOSupport	and	apply	an	AOP  interceptor node to use Hibernate.</p>
<p>We	can   also	use	HibernateTemplate	and	Callback   to	access</p>
<p>Hibernate. This is based on Inversion of Control.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>169.What types of Object Relational  Mapping (ORM) are supported by  Spring?</b></h1>
<p>Spring  supports	following  Object  Relational	Mapping (ORM)  frameworks:</p>
<p>Hibernate</p>
<p>Java Persistence API (JPA)  TopLink</p>
<p>Java Data Objects (JDO)</p>
<p>Apache Object Relational Bridge (ORB)</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>170.How will you integrate Spring  and Hibernate by using  HibernateDaoSupport?</b></h1>
<p>We can use following steps for integrating Spring and Hibernate:</p>
<p>Add dependencies for Spring and Hibernate in pom.xml  Implement DAO from HibernateDaoSupport</p>
<p>Use Hibernate functions via getHibernateTemplate() method</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>171. What are the different types of  the Transaction Management  supported by Spring framework?</b></h1>
<h2>Spring framework provides support for two types of Transaction  Management:</h2>
<h2>Programmatic: In this method, we have to manage Transaction by  programming explicitly. It provides flexibility to a developer, but it  is not easier to maintain.</h2>
<h2>Declarative: In this approach, we can separate Transaction  Management from the Application Business code. We can use  annotations or XML based configuration to manage the transactions  in declarative approach.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>172.What are the benefits provided by  Spring Framework’s Transaction  Management?</b></h1>
<p>Main benefits provided by Spring Transaction Management are:</p>
<p>Consistent: By using Spring Transaction management, we can use  consistent programming model across different transaction APIs  like- JPA, JDBC, JTA, Hibernate, JPA, JDO etc.</p>
<p>Simplicity: Spring TM provides simple API for managing the  transaction programmatically.</p>
<p>Declarative: Spring also supports annotation  or xml based  declarative transaction management.</p>
<p>Integration: Spring Transaction management is easier to integrate  with other data access abstractions of Spring.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>173.Given a choice between  declarative and programmatic  Transaction Management, which  method will you choose?</b></h1>
<p>In Spring, Declarative Transaction Management is the preferred  choice. This method is very less invasive and it has very less  impact in Application Business Logic.</p>
<p>Although Declarative method gives less flexibility than  Programmatic method, it is simpler to use and easier to maintain in  long run.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>174.	What is Aspect Oriented  Programming (AOP)</b></h1>
<p>Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm  that promotes programmers to develop code in different modules  that can be parallel or in crosscutting concerns.</p>
<p>E.g. To develop banking software, one team can work on business  logic for Money withdrawal, Money deposit, Money Transfer etc.  The other team can work on Transaction Management for  committing the transaction across multiple accounts.</p>
<p>In an Auto company, one team can work on software to integrate  with different components of car. The other team can work on how  all the components will send signal and current information to a  common dashboard.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>175. What is an Aspect in Spring?</b></h1>
<p>An Aspect is the core construct of AOP. It encapsulates the behavior  that affects multiple classes in a reusable module.</p>
<p>An Aspect can have a group of APIs that provide cross-cutting  features.</p>
<p>E.g. A logging module can be an Aspect in an Application.</p>
<p>An application can have multiple of Aspects based on the different  requirements.</p>
<p>An Aspect can be implemented by using annotation @Aspect on a  class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>176.In Spring AOP, what is the main  difference between a Concern and a  Cross cutting concern?</b></h1>
<p>A Concern in Spring is the behavior or expectation from an  application. It can be the main feature that we want to implement in  the application.</p>
<p>A Cross cutting concern is also a type of Concern. It is the feature or  functionality that is spread throughout the application in a thin way.</p>
<p>E.g. Security, Logging, Transaction Management etc. are cross  cutting concerns in an application.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>177.What is a Joinpoint in Spring  AOP?</b></h1>
<p>In Spring AOP, Joinpoint refers to a candidate point in application  where we can plug in an Aspect.</p>
<p>Joinpoint can be a method or an exception or a field getting  modified.</p>
<p>This is the place where the code of an Aspect is inserted to add new  behavior in the existing execution flow.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>178.What is an Advice in Spring  AOP?</b></h1>
<p>An Advice in Spring AOP, is an object containing the actual action  that an Aspect introduces.</p>
<p>An Advice is the code of cross cutting concern that gets executed.  There are multiple types of Advice in Spring AOP.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>179.What are the different types of  Advice in Spring AOP?</b></h1>
<p>Spring AOP provides five kinds of Advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before Advice: This type of advice runs just before a  method executes. We can use @Before annotation for this.</li>
<li>After (finally) Advice: This type of advice runs just after a  method executes. Even if the method fails, this advice will  run. We can use @After annotation here.</li>
<li>After Returning Advice: This type of advice runs after a  method executes successfully. @AfterReturning annotation  can be used here.</li>
<li>After Throwing Advice: This type of advice runs after a  method executes and throws an exception. The annotation  to be used is @AfterThrowing.</li>
<li>Around Advice: This type of advice runs before and after  the method is invoked. We use @Around annotation for  this.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>180. What is a Pointcut in Spring  AOP?</b></h1>
<p>A Pointcut in Spring AOP refers to the group of one or more  Joinpoints where an advice can be applied.</p>
<p>We can apply Advice to any Joinpoint. But we want to limit the  places where a specific type of Advice should be applied. To  achieve this we use Pointcut.</p>
<p>We can use class names, method names or regular expressions to  specify the Pointcuts for an Advice.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>181. What is an Introduction in  Spring AOP?</b></h1>
<p>In Spring AOP we can declare additional methods or fields on  behalf of a type. To do this we use an Introduction. It is also known  as inter-type declaration.</p>
<p>E.g. We can use an Introduction for making a bean implement  IsModified interface.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>182.	What is a Target object in  Spring AOP?</b></h1>
<p>A Target object is the object that gets Advice from one or more  Aspects.</p>
<p>This is also known as advised object.  In most cases it is a proxy object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>183.What is a Proxy in Spring AOP?</b></h1>
<p>In Spring AOP, a Proxy is an object created by the AOP framework  to implement Aspect contracts. It is generally a JDK dynamic proxy  or CGLIB proxy.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>184.	What are the different types of  AutoProxy creators in Spring?</b></h1>
<h2>Spring  AOP  provides	following  standard	types	of Autoproxy  creators:</h2>
<ul>
<li>BeanNameAutoProxyCreator:	This	is	a  BeanPostProcessor that creates AOP proxies for beans  automatically by matching names.</li>
<li>DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator: This  creator is more  powerful that other Proxy Creators. This also applies  eligible advisors automatically to bean in the current  context.</li>
<li>AbstractAdvisorAutoProxyCreator: This  is the parent  class of DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator. We can create  our own auto-proxy creators by extending this class.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>185.	What is Weaving in Spring  AOP?</b></h1>
<p>In Aspect oriented programming, linking Aspects with the other  application types creates an Advised object. This process is known  as Weaving.</p>
<p>Without Weaving, we just have definition of Aspects. Weaving  makes use realize full potential of the AOP.</p>
<p>Weaving can be done at compile time, load time or at run time.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>186.In Spring AOP, Weaving is done  at compile time or run time?</b></h1>
<p>Spring container performs Weaving at run time.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>187.What is XML Schema-based  Aspect implementation?</b></h1>
<p>Spring allows for implementing Aspect by using regular classes and  XML based configurations. This is different from Annotation based  Aspect implementation. But it achieves the same goal of AOP.</p>
<p>We can use elements like &lt;aop:aspect id=”testAspect&quot;  ref=&quot;testBean&quot; /&gt; and &lt;aop:pointcut id=&quot;testPointcut&quot; /&gt; in Spring  XML config file.</p>
<p>To use this we need to import Spring AOP schema as follows:</p>
<p>&lt;beans xmlns=&quot;<a href="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"><u><font color="#0000FF">http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans</u></a>&quot;  xmlns:xsi=&quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><u>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance</u></a>&quot;  xmlns:aop=&quot;<a href="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"><u>http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop</u></a>&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;<a href="http://www.springframework.org/schema/bea"><u>http://www.springframework.org/schema/bea </u></a> <a href="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-"><u>http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-</u></font></a></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">3.0.xsd</font></p>
<p><a href="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"><u><font color="#0000FF">http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop </u></a> <a href="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop-3.0.xsd"><u>http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop-3.0.xsd</u></font></a></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">&quot;&gt;</font></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>188.	What is Annotation-based  aspect implementation in Spring  AOP?</b></h1>
<p>This is a declarative style AOP implementation. In this case, we use  annotations like @Aspect, @Pointcut, @Joinpoint etc. to annotate  code with different types of AOP elements.</p>
<p>This can be used Java 5 onwards, when the support for Annotations  was introduced.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>189.	How does Spring MVC  framework work?</b></h1>
<h2>Spring provides its own Model View Controller (MVC) framework  for developing web applications.</h2>
<h2>Spring MVC framework is based on Inversion of Control (IOC)  principle. It separates the business objects from controller.</h2>
<h2>It is designed around the DispatcherServlet that is responsible for  dispatching requests to relevant handlers.</h2>
<h2>Spring MVC framework also supports annotation based binding of  request parameters.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>190.What is DispatcherServlet?</b></h1>
<p>In Spring MVC, DispatcherServlet is the core  servlet that is  responsible for handling all the requests and dispatching these to  handlers.</p>
<p>Dispatcher servlet knows the mapping between the method to be  called and the browser request. It calls the specific method and  combines the results with the matching JSP to create an html  document, and then sends it back to browser.</p>
<p>In case of RMI invocation, it sends back response to the client  application.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>191.Can we have more than one  DispatcherServlet in Spring MVC?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, a Spring MVC web application can have more than one  DispatcherServlets.</p>
<p>Each DispatcherServlet has to operate in its own namespace. It has</p>
<p>to load its own ApplicationContext with mappings, handlers, etc.</p>
<p>Only the root application context will be shared among these  Servlets.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>192.What is WebApplicationContext  in Spring MVC?</b></h1>
<p>WebApplicationContext is the child of plain ApplicationContext. It  is used in web applications. It provides features to deal with web-  related components like- controllers, view resolvers etc.</p>
<p>A Web Application can have multiple WebApplicationContext to  handle requests.</p>
<p>Each DispatcherServlet is associated with one  WebApplicationContext.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>193.What is Controller in Spring  MVC framework?</b></h1>
<p>Controller is an interface in Spring MVC. It receives  HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse in web app just like  an HttpServlet, but it is able to participate in an MVC flow.</p>
<p>Controllers are similar to a Struts Action in a Struts based Web  application.</p>
<p>Spring recommends that the implementation of Controller interface  should be a reusable, thread-safe class, capable of handling  multiple HTTP requests throughout the lifecycle of an application.</p>
<p>It is preferable to implement Controller by using a JavaBean.</p>
<p>Controller interprets user input and transforms it into a model. The  model is represented to the user by a view.</p>
<p>Spring implements a controller in a very generic way. This enables  us to create a wide variety of controllers.</p>
<p>What is @Controller annotation in Spring MVC?</p>
<p>We use @ Controller annotation to indicate that a class is a  Controller in Spring MVC.</p>
<p>The dispatcher in Spring scans for @Controller annotated classes  for mapped methods and detects @RequestMapping.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>194.	What is @RequestMapping  annotation in Spring?</b></h1>
<h2>In Spring MVC, we use @RequestMapping annotation to map a web  request to either a class or a handler method.</h2>
<h2>In @RequestMapping we can specify the path of URL as well as  HTTP method like- GET, PUT, POST etc.</h2>
<h2>@RequestMapping also supports specifying HTTP Headers as  attributes.</h2>
<h2>We can also map different media types produced by a controller in  @RequestMapping. We use HTTP Header Accepts for this purpose.</h2>
<h2>E.g. @RequestMapping(  value = &quot;/test/mapping&quot;,  method = GET,</h2>
<h2>headers = &quot;Accept=application/json&quot;)</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>195.What are the main features of  Spring MVC?</b></h1>
<p>Spring MVC has following main features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear separation of role: In Spring MVC, each  role   like-   controller, validator, command  object, form  object, model object, DispatcherServlet, handler mapping,  view resolver etc. is fulfilled by a specialized object.</li>
<li>Reusability: Spring MVC promotes reusable business code  that reduces the need for duplication. We can use existing  business objects as command or form objects instead of  copying them to extend a particular framework base class.</li>
<li>Flexible Model Transfer: Spring MVC Model transfer  supports easy integration with other view technologies as  well.</li>
<li>Customizable binding and validation: In Spring MVC, we  can to custom binding between Requests and Controllers.  Even validation can be done on non-String values as well.</li>
<li>JSP form tag library: From Spring 2.0, there is a powerful  JSP form tag library that makes writing forms in JSP pages  much easier.</li>
<li>Customizable locale, time zone and theme resolution:  Spring MVC supports customization in locale, timezone  etc.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>196. What is the difference between a  Singleton and Prototype bean in  Spring?</b></h1>
<p>Every bean in Spring has a scope that defines its existence  timeframe in the application.</p>
<p>Singleton scope for bean limits a bean to a single object instance  per Spring IOC container.</p>
<p>This single instance is limited to a specific ApplicationContext. If  there are multiple ApplicationContext then we can have more than  one instance of bean.</p>
<p>By default all the beans in Spring framework are Singleton scope  beans.</p>
<p>With Prototype scope a single bean definition can have multiple  object instances in a Spring container.</p>
<p>In prototype scope bean, the Spring IoC container creates new bean  instance of the object every time a request for that specific bean is  made.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>197.How will you decide which scope-  Prototype or Singleton to use for a  bean in Spring?</b></h1>
<h2>In general, we use prototype scope for all stateful beans and  singleton scope for stateless beans.</h2>
<h2>Since a stateless bean does not maintain any state, we can use the  same object instance again and again. Singleton scope bean serves  the same purpose.</h2>
<h2>In a stateful bean, there is a need to maintain the state in each  request, it is necessary to use a new instance of object with each  call. A Prototype scope bean ensures that we get a new instance  each time we request for the object.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>198.	What is the difference between  Setter and Constructor based  Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring  framework?</b></h1>
<p>and	Constructor</p>
<p>based</p>
<p>Main	differences	between	Setter  Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring are:</p>
<p>Priority: Setter based injection has higher priority than a constructor  based injection in Spring. If an application uses Setter as well as  Constructor injection, Spring container uses the Setter injection.</p>
<p>Partial dependency: We can inject partial dependency by using  Setter injection. In Constructor injection, it is not possible to do just  a partial dependency injection.</p>
<p>E.g. If there are two properties in a class, we can use Setter method  to inject just one property in the class.</p>
<p>Flexibility: Setter injection gives more flexibility in introducing  changes. One can easily change the value by Setter injection. In case  of Constructor injection a new bean instance has to be created  always.</p>
<p>Readability: Setter injection is more readable than Constructor  injection. Generally Setter method name is similar to dependency  class being used in setter method.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>199.What are the drawbacks of Setter  based Dependency Injection (DI) in  Spring?</b></h1>
<p>Although Setter based Dependency Injection has higher priority than  Constructor based DI, there are some disadvantages of it.</p>
<p>No Guarantee: In Setter based DI, there is no guarantee that a  certain dependency is injected or not. We may have an object with  partial or no dependency. Whereas in Constructor based DI, an  object in not created till the time all the dependencies are ready.</p>
<p>Security: One can use Setter based DI to override another  dependency. This can cause Security breach in a Spring application.</p>
<p>Circular Dependency: Setter based  DI  can cause circular  dependency between objects. Where as Constructor based DI will  throw ObjectCurrentlyInCreationException if there is a circular  dependency during the creation of an object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>200.	What are the differences  between Dependency Injection (DI)  and Factory Pattern?</b></h1>
<p>Main differences between Dependency Injection (DI) and Factory  Pattern are:</p>
<p>Coupling: Factory pattern adds tight coupling between an object,  factory and dependency. In case of DI, there is no coupling between  objects. We just mention the dependencies on different objects and  container resolves and introduces these dependencies.</p>
<p>Easier Testing: DI is easier to test, since we can inject the mock  objects as dependency in Test environment. In case of Factory  pattern, we need to create actual objects for testing.</p>
<p>Flexibility: DI  allows for switching between different DI  frameworks easily. It gives flexibility in the choice of DI  framework.</p>
<p>Container: DI always needs a container for injecting the  dependencies. This leads to extra overhead as well as extra code in  your application. In factory pattern, you can just use POJO classes  to implement the application without any container.</p>
<p>Cleaner Code: DI code is much cleaner than Factory pattern based  code. In DI, we do not need to add extra code for factory methods.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>201.In Spring framework, what is the  difference between  FileSystemResource and  ClassPathResource?</b></h1>
<p>In Spring we can specify configuration by using a file or classpath.</p>
<p>In FileSystemResource we have to give absolute path / relative path  of Spring Configuration file spring-config.xml file.</p>
<p>In ClassPathResource Spring looks for Spring Configuration file  spring-config.xml in ClassPath. Therefore, developer has to include  spring-config.xml in classpath.</p>
<p>ClassPathResource looks for configuration file in CLASSPATH,  whereas FileSystemResource looks for configuration file in file  system.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>202.	Name some popular Spring  framework annotations that you use  in your project?</b></h1>
<p>Spring has many Annotations to serve different purposes. For  regular use we refer following popular Spring annotations:</p>
<p>@Controller: This annotation is for creating controller classes in a  Spring MVC project.</p>
<p>@RequestMapping: This annotation maps the URI to a controller  handler method in Spring MVC.</p>
<p>@ResponseBody: For sending an Object as response we use this  annotation.</p>
<p>@PathVariable: To map dynamic values from a URI to handler  method arguments, we use this annotation.</p>
<p>@Autowired: This annotation indicates to Spring for auto-wiring  dependencies in beans.</p>
<p>@Service: This annotation marks the service classes in Spring.  @Scope: We can define the scope of Spring bean by this annotation.</p>
<p>@Configuration:	This	an	annotation	for	Java	based	Spring  configuration.</p>
<p>@Aspect, @Before, @After, @Around, @Joinpoint, @Pointcut:  These are the annotations in Spring for AspectJ AOP.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>203.	How can you upload a file in  Spring MVC Application?</b></h1>
<p>In Spring MVC framework we can use MultipartResolver interface  to upload a file. We need to make configuration changes to make it  work. After uploading the file, we have to create Controller handler  method to process the uploaded file in application.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>204.	What are the different types of  events provided by Spring  framework?</b></h1>
<p>Spring framework provides following five events for Context:</p>
<p>ContextRefreshedEvent: Whenever ApplicationContext is  initialized or refreshed, Spring publishes this event. We can also  raise it by using refresh() method on  ConfigurableApplicationContext interface.</p>
<p>ContextStartedEvent: When ApplicationContext is started using  start() method on ConfigurableApplicationContext interface,  ContextStartedEvent is published. We can poll database or restart  any stopped application after receiving this event.</p>
<p>ContextStoppedEvent: Spring publishes this event when  ApplicationContext is stopped using stop() method on  ConfigurableApplicationContext interface. This is used for doing  any cleanup work.</p>
<p>ContextClosedEvent: Once the ApplicationContext is closed using  close() method, ContextClosedEvent is published. Once a context is  closed, it is the last stage of its lifecycle. After this it cannot be  refreshed or restarted.</p>
<p>RequestHandledEvent: This is a web specific event that informs to  all beans that an HTTP request has been serviced.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>205.	What is the difference between  DispatcherServlet and  ContextLoaderListener in Spring?</b></h1>
<h2>DispatcherServlet is the core of Spring MVC application. It loads  Spring bean configuration file and initialize all the beans mentioned  in config file.</h2>
<h2>In case we have enabled annotations in Spring config file, it also  scans the packages and configures any bean annotated with  @Component, @Controller, @Repository or @Service annotations.</h2>
<h2>ContextLoaderListener is a listener to start up and shut down  Spring’s root WebApplicationContext. ContextLoaderListener links  the lifecycle of ApplicationContext  to the lifecycle of the  ServletContext. It automates the creation of ApplicationContext. It  can also be used to define shared beans used across different spring  contexts.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>206.	How will you handle  exceptions in Spring MVC  Framework?</b></h1>
<h2>Spring MVC Framework provides following mechanisms to help us  achieve exception handling:</h2>
<h2>Controller Based: A developer can define exception handler  methods in a Controller class. To do so, they have to annotate the  methods with @ExceptionHandler annotation.</h2>
<h2>Global Exception Handler: Spring provides @ControllerAdvice  annotation for exception handling as cross-cutting concern. We can  mark any class as global exception handler by using this annotation.</h2>
<h2>HandlerExceptionResolver implementation: Spring Framework  provides HandlerExceptionResolver interface that can be  implemented to create a global exception handler.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>207.	What are the best practices of  Spring Framework?</b></h1>
<p>In Spring Framework, following are some of the best practices:</p>
<p>We can Divide spring bean configurations based on their concerns  such as spring-jdbc.xml, spring-security.xml.</p>
<p>It is better to avoid version numbers in schema reference. This  makes sure that we have the latest config files.</p>
<p>It is a good practice to configure bean dependencies as much as  possible. Unless there is a good reason, we try to avoid autowiring.</p>
<p>For spring beans that are used in multiple contexts in Spring MVC,  we can create them in root context and initialize with listener.</p>
<p>Spring framework provides many features and modules. We should  just use what we need for our application. An extra dependency has  to be removed</p>
<p>For application properties, it is good to create a property file and  read it in Spring configuration file.</p>
<p>Annotations are useful for  smaller applications, but for  larger  applications annotations can become an overhead. It is easier to  maintain if all the configurations are in xml files.</p>
<p>When we are doing AOP, we have to make sure to keep the  Joinpoint as narrow as possible to avoid Advice on unwanted  methods.</p>
<p>We should use right annotation for components or services. For  services use @Service and for DAO beans use @Repository.</p>
<p>Dependency Injection (DI) has to be used when there is real benefit.  It should not be used just for the sake of loose coupling.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>208.	What is Spring Boot?</b></h1>
<p>Spring Boot is a ready made solution to create Spring applications  with production grade features. It favors convention over  configuration.</p>
<p>We can embed Tomcat or Jetty in in an application created with  Spring Boot. Spring Boot automatically configures Spring in an  application.</p>
<p>It does not require any code generation or xml configuration. It is an  easy solution to create applications that can run stand-alone.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Hibernate</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>209.	What is Hibernate  framework?</b></h1>
<p>Hibernate is a popular Object Relational Mapping (ORM)  framework of Java. It helps in mapping the Object Oriented Domain  model to Relational Database tables.</p>
<p>Hibernate is a free software distributed under GNU license.</p>
<p>Hibernate also provides implementation of Java Persistence API  (JPA).</p>
<p>In simple words, it is a framework to retrieve and store data from  database tables from Java.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>210.What is an Object Relational  Mapping (ORM)?</b></h1>
<h2>Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique to  map data from a relational database to Object oriented domain  model. This is the core of Hibernate framework.</h2>
<h2>In case of Java, most of the software is based on OOPS design. But  the data stored in Database is based on Relation Database  Management System (RDBMS).</h2>
<h2>ORM helps in data retrieval in an Object Oriented way from an  RDBMS. It reduces the effort of developers in writing queries to  access and insert data.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>211.What is the purpose of  Configuration Interface in  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Configuration interface can be implemented in an application to  specify the properties and mapping documents for creating a  SessionFactory in Hibernate.</p>
<p>By default, a new instance of Configuration uses properties  mentioned in hibernate.properties file.</p>
<p>Configuration is mainly an initialization time object that loads the  properties in helps in creating SessionFactory with these properties.</p>
<p>In short, Configuration interface is used for configuring Hibernate  framework in an application.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>212.What is Object Relational  Impedance Mismatch?</b></h1>
<h2>Object Relational Impedance Mismatch (ORIM) is also known as  paradigm mismatch. It means that Object model and Relational  model do not work well with each other.</h2>
<h2>Relational model or a RDBMS represents data in tabular format  like a spreadsheet. Object model or OOPS represents the data as an  inter-connected graph of objects.</h2>
<h2>Mixing these two models leads to various problems. The common  name for these issues is Object Relational Impedance Mismatch.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>213.What are the main problems of  Object Relational Impedance  Mismatch?</b></h1>
<p>Object model and Relational models (RDBMS) have following  problems that are part of Object Relational Impedance Mismatch:</p>
<p>Granularity: Object model is more granular than Relational model.  There are more classes in object model than the corresponding  tables in relational model.</p>
<p>Inheritance: Object model supports inheritance. But Relational  model does not have any concept of inheritance.</p>
<p>Identity: Relational model has just one criteria for sameness of data.  It is based on primary key. In object model like Java we can have  equals as well as == for sameness of objects.</p>
<p>Associations: In Object model associations are uni-directional. In  RDBMS, there is a concept of foreign key for association. Also  multiplicity of a relationship is hard to judge by looking at object  model.</p>
<p>Data navigation: In Object model, you can move from one object to  another object for getting data. Egg. you can retrieve and Employee  object, then go to its department object and then get the employees  in the department object. In RDBMS, we try to minimize the SQL  calls, so we get all the data by using joins.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>214.	What are the key  characteristics of Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Hibernate has following key characteristics:</p>
<p>Object/Relational Mapping (ORM): Hibernate provides  ORM  capabilities to developers. So then can write code in Object model  for connecting with data in Relational model.</p>
<p>JPA Provider: Hibernate provides an excellent implementation of  Java Persistence API (JPA) specification.</p>
<p>Idiomatic persistence: Hibernate provides persistence based on  natural Object-oriented idioms with full support for inheritance,  polymorphism, association, composition, and the Java collections  framework. It can work with any data for persistence.</p>
<p>High Performance: Hibernate provides high level of performance  supporting features like- lazy initialization, multiple fetching  strategies, optimistic locking etc. Hibernate does not need its own  database tables or fields. It can generate SQL at system  initialization to provide better performance at runtime.</p>
<p>Scalability: Hibernate works well in multi server clusters. It has  built in scalability support. It can work well for small projects as  well as for large business software.</p>
<p>Reliable: Hibernate very reliable and stable framework. This is the  reason for its worldwide acceptance and popularity among  developer community.</p>
<p>Extensible: Hibernate is quite generic in nature. It can be configured  and extended as per the use case of application.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>215.Can you tell us about the core  interfaces of Hibernate framework?</b></h1>
<p>The core interfaces of Hibernate framework are as follows:</p>
<p>Configuration: Configuration interface can be implemented in an  application to specify the properties and mapping documents for  creating a SessionFactory in Hibernate. Hibernate application  bootstraps by using this interface.</p>
<p>SessionFactory: In Hibernate, SessionFactory is used to create and  manage Sessions. Generally, there is one SessionFactory created for  one database. It is a thread-safe interface that works well in multi-  threaded applications.</p>
<p>Session: Session is a lightweight object that is used at runtime  between a Java application and Hibernate. It contains methods to  create, read and delete operations for entity classes. It is a basic  class that abstracts the concept of persistence.</p>
<p>Transaction: This is an optional interface. It is a short lived object  that is used for encapsulating the overall work based on unit of  work design pattern. A Session can have multiple Transactions.</p>
<p>Query: This  interface encapsulates the behavior of an object-  oriented query in Hibernate. It can accept parameters and execute  the queries to fetch results. Same query can be executed multiple  times.</p>
<p>Criteria: This is a simplified API to retrieve objects by creating  Criterion objects. It is very easy to use for creating Search like  features.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>216.How will you map the columns of  a DB table to the properties of a Java  class in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>We can map the class properties and table columns by using one of  the two ways:</p>
<p>XML: We can map the column of a table to the property of a class in  XML file. It is generally with extension hbm.xml</p>
<p>Annotation: We can also use annotations @Entity and @Table to  map a column to the property of a class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>217.Does Hibernate make it  mandatory for a mapping file to have
.hbm.xml extension?</b></h1>
<p>No. It is a convention to have.hbm.xml extension in the name of a  mapping file. It is not a requirement enforced by Hibernate. We can  use any other extension of our convenience for this.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>218.	What are the steps for creating  a SessionFactory in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Steps to create a SessionFactory in Hibernate are:</p>
<p>Configuration: First create a Configuration object. This will refer to  the path of configuration file.</p>
<p>Resource: Add config file resource to Configuration object.</p>
<p>Properties: Set properties in the Configuration object.  SessionFactory: Use Configuration object to build SessionFactory.</p>
<p>Egg.</p>
<p>Configuration config = new Configuration();  config.addResource(“testInstance/configuration.hbm.xml”);  config.setProperties( System.getProperties() );  SessionFactory sessions = config.buildSessionFactory();</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>219.Why do we use POJO in  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<h2>POJO stands for Plain Old Java Objects. A POJO is java bean with  getter and setter methods for each property of the bean.</h2>
<h2>It is a simple class that encapsulates an object’s properties and  provides access through setters and getters.</h2>
<h2>Some of the reasons for using POJO in Hibernate are:</h2>
<h2>POJO emphasizes the fact that this class is a simple Java class, not  a heavy class like EJB.</h2>
<h2>POJO is a well-constructed class, so it works well with Hibernate  proxies.</h2>
<h2>POJO also comes with a default constructor that makes it easier to  persist with a default constructor.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>220.	What is Hibernate Query  Language (HQL)?</b></h1>
<p>Hibernate Query Language is also known as HQL. It is an Object  Oriented language. But it is similar to SQL.</p>
<p>HQL works well with persistent objects and their properties. HQL  does not work on database tables.</p>
<p>HQL queries are translated into native SQL queries specific to a  database.</p>
<p>HQL supports direct running of native SQL queries also. But it  creates an issue in Database portability.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>221.How will you call a stored  procedure in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Hibernate supports executing not only simple queries but also  stored procedure of database. There are three ways to call a stored  procedure in Hibernate:</p>
<p>XML mapping file:</p>
<p>We can declare the store procedure inside XML Mapping file.</p>
<p>&lt;!-- Employee.hbm.xml --&gt;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&lt;hibernate-mapping&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;class	name=&quot;com.testHibernate.util.Employee&quot;  table=&quot;employee&quot; ...&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;id name=&quot;employeeId&quot; type=&quot;java.lang.Integer&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;column name=“EMPLOYEE_ID&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;generator class=&quot;identity&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/id&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;property name=&quot;employeeId&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;column name=&quot;EMPLOYEE_ID&quot; length=&quot;10&quot; not-  null=&quot;true&quot; unique=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/property&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/class&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;sql-query name=&quot;callEmployeeStoreProcedure&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;return	alias=&quot;employee&quot;</p>
<p>class=&quot;com.testHibernate.util.Employee&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;![CDATA[CALL GetEmployees(:employeeId)]]&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/sql-query&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;</p>
<p>We can call it with getNamedQuery().</p>
<p>Query	query</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>session.getNamedQuery(&quot;callEmployeeStoreProcedure&quot;)</p>
<p>.setParameter(&quot;employeeId&quot;, “1234”);  List result = query.list();</p>
<p>for(int i=0; i&lt;result.size(); i++){</p>
<p>Employee employee = (Employee)result.get(i);  System.out.println(employee.getEmployeeCode());</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Native SQL: We can use Native SQL to call a store procedure query  directly. In this example GetEmployees() stored procedure is being  called.</p>
<p>Query query = session.createSQLQuery(  &quot;CALL GetEmployees(:employeeId)&quot;)</p>
<p>.addEntity(Employee.class)</p>
<p>.setParameter(&quot;employeeId&quot;, “1234);</p>
<p>List result = query.list();</p>
<p>for(int i=0; i&lt;result.size(); i++){</p>
<p>Employee employee = (Employee) result.get(i);  System.out.println(employee.getEmployeeCode());</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Use annotation:</p>
<p>We	can	also	mark	out</p>
<p>stored	procedure</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>@NamedNativeQueries annotation.</p>
<p>//Employee.java</p>
<p>@NamedNativeQueries({  @NamedNativeQuery(</p>
<p>name = &quot;callEmployeeStoreProcedure&quot;,</p>
<p>query = &quot;CALL GetEmployees(:employeeId)&quot;,  resultClass = Employee.class</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>})</p>
<p>@Entity</p>
<p>@Table(name = &quot;employee&quot;)</p>
<p>public class Employee implements java.io.Serializable {</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Call it with getNamedQuery().</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>Query	query</p>
<p>session.getNamedQuery(&quot;callEmployeeStoreProcedure&quot;)</p>
<p>.setParameter(&quot;employeeId&quot;, “1234”);  List result = query.list();</p>
<p>for(int i=0; i&lt;result.size(); i++){</p>
<p>Employee employee = (Employee)result.get(i);  System.out.println(employee.getEmployeeCode());</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>222.	What is Criteria API in  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Criteria is a simplified API in Hibernate to get entities from  database by creating Criterion objects.</p>
<p>It is a very intuitive and convenient approach for search features.  Users can specify different criteria for  searching entities and  Criteria API can handle these.</p>
<p>Criterion instances are obtained through factory methods on  Restrictions.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>223.	Why do we use  HibernateTemplate?</b></h1>
<p>This is a trap question. HibernateTemplate has been deprecated.  There were earlier good reasons to use HibernateTemplate. But  now the trend has changed towards not using it anymore.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>224.	How can you see SQL code  generated by Hibernate on console?</b></h1>
<p>To display the SQL generated by Hibernate, we have to turn on the  show_sql flag.</p>
<p>This can be done in Hibernate configuration as follows:</p>
<p>&lt;property name=”show_sql”&gt;true&lt;/property&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>225.	What are the different types of  collections supported by Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Hibernate supports following two types of collections:</p>
<p>Indexed Collections: List and Maps</p>
<p>Sorted Collections: java.util.SortedMap and java.util.SortedSet</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>226.	What is the difference between  session.save() and  session.saveOrUpdate() methods in  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Save method first stores an object in the database. Then it persists  the given transient instance by assigning a generated identifier.  Finally, it returns the id of the entity that is just created.</p>
<p>SaveOrUpdate() method calls either save() or update() method. It  selects one of these methods based on the existence of identifier.</p>
<p>If an identifier exists for the entity then update() method is called. If  there is no identifier for the entity then save() method is called as  mentioned earlier.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>227.	What are the advantages of  Hibernate framework over JDBC?</b></h1>
<h2>Main advantages of Hibernate over JDBC are as follows:</h2>
<h2>Database Portability: Hibernate can be used with multiple types of  database with easy portability. In JDBC, developer has to write  database specific native queries. These native queries can reduce  the database portability of the code.</h2>
<h2>Connection Pool: Hibernate handles connection pooling very well.  JDBC requires connection pooling to be defined by developer.</h2>
<h2>Complexity: Hibernate handles complex query scenarios very well  with its internal API like Criteria. So developer need not gain  expertise in writing complex SQL queries. In JDBC application  developer writes most of the queries.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>228.	How can we get statistics of a  SessionFactory in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>In Hibernate we can get the statistics of a SessionFactory by using  Statistics interface. We can get information like Close Statement  count, Collection Fetch count, Collection Load count, Entity insert  count etc.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>229.	What is the Transient state of  an object in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<h2>When an object is just instantiated using the new operator but is not  associated with a Hibernate Session, then the object is in Transient  state.</h2>
<h2>In Transient state, object does not have a persistent representation  in database. Also there is no identifier assigned to an object in  Transient state.</h2>
<h2>An object in Transient state can be garbage collected if there is no  reference pointing to it.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>230.	What is the Detached state of  an object in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>An object is in detached state if it was persistent earlier but its  Session is closed now.</p>
<p>Any reference to this object is still valid. We can even update this  object. Later on we can even attach an object in detached state to a  new session and make it persistent.</p>
<p>Detached state is very useful in application transactions where a  user takes some time to finish the work.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>231.What is the use of Dirty Checking  in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Dirty Checking is very useful feature of Hibernate for write to  database operations. Hibernate monitors all the persistent objects  for any changes. It can detect if an object has been modified or not.</p>
<p>By Dirty Checking, only those fields of an object are updated that  require any change in them. It reduces the time-consuming database  write operations.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>232.	What is the purpose of  Callback interface in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Callback  interface   in  Hibernate   is	mainly  used   for	receiving  notifications of different events from an object.</p>
<p>Egg. We can use Callback to get the notification when an object is  loaded into or removed from database.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>233.	What are the different ORM  levels in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>There are following four different ORM levels in Hibernate:</p>
<p>Pure Relational ORM: At this level entire application is designed  around the relational model. All the operations are SQL based at  this level.</p>
<p>Light Object Mapping: At this level entity classes are mapped  manually to relational tables. Business logic code is hidden from  data access code. Applications with less number of entities use this  level.</p>
<p>Medium Object Mapping: In this case, application is designed  around an object model. Most of the SQL code is generated at  compile time. Associations between objects are supported by the  persistence mechanism. Object-oriented expression language is  used to specify queries.</p>
<p>Full Object Mapping: This is one of the most sophisticated object  modeling level. It supports composition, inheritance, polymorphism  and persistence. The persistent classes do not inherit any special  base class at this level. There are efficient fetching and caching  strategies implemented transparently to the application.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>234.	What are the different ways to  configure a Hibernate application?</b></h1>
<p>There are mainly two ways to configure Hibernate application:</p>
<p>XML based: We can define the Hibernate configuration in an XML  file like ibernate.cfg.xml file</p>
<p>Programming based: We can also use code logic to configure  Hibernate in our application.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>235.	What is Query Cache in  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Hibernate provides Query Cache to improve the performance of  queries that run multiple times with same parameters.</p>
<p>At times Query Caching can reduce the performance of  Transactional processing. By default Query Cache is disabled in  Hibernate.</p>
<p>It has to be used based on the benefits gained by it in performance  of the queries in an application.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>236.	What are the different types of  Association mappings supported by  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Hibernate supports following four types of Association mappings:</p>
<p>Unidirectional association: This kind of association works in only  one direction.</p>
<p>Unidirectional association with join tables</p>
<p>Bidirectional association: This kind of association works in both  directions.</p>
<p>Bidirectional association with join tables</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>237.	What are the different types of  Unidirectional Association mappings  in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>In Hibernate there can be following three types of Unidirectional  Association mappings:</p>
<p>Many to one  One to one  One to many</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>238.	What is Unit of Work design  pattern?</b></h1>
<h2>Unit of Work is a design pattern to define business transactions.</h2>
<h2>A Unit of Work is a list of ordered operations that we want to run on  a database together. Either all of these go together or none of these  goes.</h2>
<h2>Most of the time, we use term business transaction in place of Unit  of Work.</h2>
<h2>Egg. In case of money transfer from account A to B, the unit of work  can be two operation Debit account A and Credit account B in a  sequence. Both these operations should happen together and in right  sequence.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>239.	In Hibernate, how can an  object go in Detached state?</b></h1>
<p>Once the session attached to an Object is closed, the object goes  into Detached state. An Object in Detached state can be attached to  another session at a later point of time.</p>
<p>This state is quite useful in concurrent applications that have long  unit of work.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>240.	How will you order the results  returned by a Criteria in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<h2>Hibernate provides an Order criterion that can be used to order the  results. This can be order objects based on their property in  ascending or descending order.</h2>
<h2>Class is org.hibernate.criterion.Order.  One example is as follows:</h2>
<h2>Egg.</h2>
<h2>List employees = session.createCriteria(Employee.class)</h2>
<h2>.add( Restrictions.like(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;F%&quot;)</h2>
<h2>.addOrder( Order.asc(&quot;name&quot;) )</h2>
<h2>.addOrder( Order.desc(&quot;age&quot;) )</h2>
<h2>.setMaxResults(10)</h2>
<h2>.list();</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>241.	How does Example criterion  work in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<h2>In Hibernate, we can create an object with desired properties. Then  we can use this object to search for objects with similar object. For  this we can use org.hibernate.criterion.Example criterion.</h2>
<h2>Egg. First we create a sample book object of author Richard and  category mystery. Then we search for similar books.</h2>
<h2>Book book = new Book();  book.setAuthor(‘Richard’);  book.setCategory(Category.MYSTERY);</h2>
<h2>List results = session.createCriteria(Book.class)</h2>
<h2>.add( Example.create(book) )</h2>
<h2>.list();</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>242.	How does Transaction</b></h1>
<p><b>management work in Hibernate?</b></p>
<p>In Hibernate we use Session interface to get a new transaction.  Once we get the transaction we can run business operations in that  transaction. At the end of successful business operations, we  commit the transaction. In case  of failure, we rollback the  transaction.</p>
<p>Sample code is a follows:</p>
<p>Session s = null;  Transaction trans = null;  try {</p>
<p>s = sessionFactory.openSession();</p>
<p>trans = s.beginTransaction();  doTheAction(s);  trans.commit();</p>
<p>} catch (RuntimeException exc) {</p>
<p>trans.rollback();</p>
<p>} finally {  s.close();</p>
<p>}</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>243.	How can we mark an  entity/collection as immutable in  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>In Hibernate, by default an entity or collection is mutable. We can  add, delete or update an entity/collection.</p>
<p>To mark an entity/collection as immutable, we can use one of the  following:</p>
<p>@Immutable: We can use the annotation @Immutable to mark an  entity/collection immutable.</p>
<p>XML file: We can also set the property mutable=false in the XML  file for an entity to make it immutable.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>244. What are the different options  to retrieve an object from database in  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<h2>In Hibernate, we can use one of the following options to retrieve  objects from database:</h2>
<h2>Identifier: We can use load() or get() method and pass the identifier  like primary key to fetch an object from database.</h2>
<h2>HQL: We can create a HQL query and get the object after executing  the query.</h2>
<h2>Criteria  API:	We can use  Criteria API to create the search  conditions for getting the objects from database.</h2>
<h2>Native SQL: We can write native SQL query for a database and just  execute it to get the data we want and convert it into desired object.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>245.	How can we auto-generate  primary key in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>We	can	use	the	primary	key	generation	strategy</p>
<p>of	type</p>
<h2>GenerationType.AUTO	to	auto-generate	primary	key	while  persisting an object in Hibernate.</h2>
<h2>Egg.  @Id</h2>
<h2>@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)</h2>
<h2>private int id;</h2>
<h2>We can leave it null/0 while persisting and Hibernate automatically  generates a primary key for us.</h2>
<h2>Sometimes, AUTO strategy refers to a SEQUENCE instead of an  IDENTITY .</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>246.	How will you re-attach an  object in Detached state in  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>We can call one of the methods Session.update(),  Session.saveOrUpdate(), or Session.merge() to re-attach an object  in detached state with another session in Hibernate.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>247.	What is the first level of cache  in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>A Hibernate Session is the first level of cache for persistent data in  a transaction.</p>
<p>The second level of cache is at JVM or SessionFactory level.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>248.	What are the different second  level caches available in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<h2>In Hibernate, we can use different cache providers for implementing  second level cache at JVM/SessionFactory level.</h2>
<h2>Some of these are:</h2>
<h2>Hashtable  EHCache  OSCache  SwarmCache  JBoss Cache 1.x  JBoss Cache 2</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>249.	Which is the default  transaction factory in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>In Hibernate, default transaction factory is  JDBCTransactionFactory. But we can change it by setting the  property hibernate.transaction.factory_class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>250.	What are the options to disable  second level cache in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<h2>This is a trick question. By default Second level cache is already  disabled in Hibernate.</h2>
<h2>In case, your project is using a second level cache you can use one  of the following options to disable second level cache in Hibernate:</h2>
<h2>We can set hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache to false.</h2>
<h2>We can use CacheMode.IGNORE to stop interaction between the  session and second-level cache. Session will interact with cache  only to invalidate cache items when updates occur</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>251.What are the different fetching  strategies in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Hibernate 3 onwards there are following fetching strategies to  retrieve associated objects:</p>
<p>Join fetching: In Join strategy Hibernate uses OUTER join to  retrieve the associated instance or collection in the same SELECT.</p>
<p>Select fetching: In Select strategy, Hibernate uses a second SELECT  to retrieve the associated entity or collection. We can explicitly  disable lazy fetching by specifying lazy=&quot;false&quot;. By default lazy  fetching is true.</p>
<p>Subselect fetching: In Subselect strategy, Hibernate uses a second  SELECT to retrieve the associated collections for  all entities  retrieved in a previous query or fetch.</p>
<p>Batch fetching: In Batch strategy, Hibernate uses a single SELECT  to retrieve a batch of entity instances or collections by specifying a  list of primary or foreign keys. This is a very good performance  optimization strategy for select fetching.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>252.	What is the difference between  Immediate fetching and Lazy  collection fetching?</b></h1>
<p>In Immediate fetching an association, collection or attribute is  retrieved at the same time when the owner is loaded.</p>
<p>But in Lazy collection fetching, a collection is fetched only when an</p>
<p>operation is invoked on that collection by client application.</p>
<p>This is the default fetching strategy for collections in Hibernate.  Lazy fetching is better from performance perspective.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>253.	What is ‘Extra lazy fetching’ in  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>In Extra lazy fetching, only individual elements of a collection are  fetched from the database when they are required.</p>
<p>In this strategy, Hibernate does not fetch the whole collection into  memory unless it is essential.</p>
<p>It is a good fetching strategy for large collections of objects.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>254.	How can we check is a  collection is initialized or not under  Lazy Initialization strategy?</b></h1>
<p>Hibernate provides two convenient methods, Hibernate.initialize()  and Hibernate.isInitialized() to check whether a collection is  initialized or not.</p>
<p>By using Hibernate.initialize() we can force the initialization of a  collection in Hibernate.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>255.	What are the different  strategies for cache mapping in  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Hibernate provides following strategies for cache mapping:</p>
<p>Read only: If an application requires caching only for read but not  for write operations, then we can use this strategy. It is very simple  to use and give very good performance benefit.</p>
<p>It is also safe to use in a cluster environment.</p>
<p>Read/Write: If an application  also needs caching for  write  operations, then we use Read/Write strategy.</p>
<p>Read/write cache strategy should not be used if there is requirement  for serializable transaction isolation level.</p>
<p>If we want to use it in a cluster environment, we need to implement  locking mechanism.</p>
<p>Nonstrict Read/Write: If an application only occasionally updates  the data, then we can use this strategy. It cannot be used in systems  with serializable transaction isolation level requirement.</p>
<p>Transactional: This  strategy supports full transactional cache  providers like JBoss TreeCache.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>256.	What is the difference between  a Set and a Bag in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>A Bag in Hibernate is an unordered collection. It can have duplicate  elements. When we persist an object in a bag, there is no guarantee  that bag will maintain any order.</p>
<p>A Set in Hibernate can only store unique objects. If we add the same  element to set second time, it just replaces the old one. By default a  Set is unordered collection in Hibernate.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>257. How can we monitor the  performance of Hibernate in an  application?</b></h1>
<p>We can use following ways to monitor Hibernate performance:</p>
<p>Monitoring SessionFactory: Since there is one SessionFactory in an  application, we can collect the statistics of a SessionFactory to  monitor the performance. Hibernate provides  sessionFactory.getStatistics() method to get the statistics of  SessionFactory.</p>
<p>Hibernate can also use JMX to publish metrics.</p>
<p>Metrics: In Hibernate we can also collect other metrics like-  number of open sessions, retrieved JDBC connections, cache hit,  miss etc.</p>
<p>These metrics give great insight into the performance of Hibernate.  We can tune Hibernate settings and strategies based on these  metrics.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>258. How can we check if an Object  is in Persistent, Detached or Transient  state in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>We can use following methods to check the state of an object in  Hibernate:</p>
<p>Persistent State: If call to EntityManager.contains(object) returns  true, the object is in Persistent state.</p>
<p>Detached	State:	If	the	call	to  PersistenceUnitUtil.getIdentifier(object) returns identifier property  then the object is in detached state.</p>
<p>Transient State: If call to PersistenceUnitUtil.getIdentifier(object)  returns null then object is in Transient state.</p>
<p>We can get access to PersistenceUnitUtil from the  EntityManagerFactory in Hibernate.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>259.	What is ‘the inverse side of  association’ in a mapping?</b></h1>
<h2>Let us consider an example in which a customer can have multiple  orders and for every order there has to be a customer.</h2>
<h2>In OO world, customer is the owner of order. In SQL world, an  Order has reference to customer id.</h2>
<h2>It is a bi-directional one to many mapping from customer to order.</h2>
<h2>The inverse side in this mapping is the owner of object. In this case  customer is the owner or order. Since an order cannot exist without  a customer. But a customer can exist without an order.</h2>
<h2>Also customer has no column to save order data. But an Order table  can store customer id, which is used for mapping.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>260.	What is ORM metadata?</b></h1>
<p>ORM uses metadata for its internal work. ORM maintains metadata  to generate code used for accessing columns and tables.</p>
<p>ORM maps classes to tables and stores this information in  Metadata. It maps fields in classes to columns in tables. These kinds  of mappings are also part of Metadata.</p>
<p>Application developers can also access Hibernate Metadata by  using ClassMetadata and CollectionMetadata interfaces and Type  hierarchy.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>261.What is the difference between  load() and get() method in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<h2>In Hibernate, load() and get() methods are quite similar in  functionality.</h2>
<h2>The main difference is that load() method will throw an  ObjectNotFoundException if row corresponding to an object is not  found in the database.</h2>
<h2>On the other hand, get() method returns null value when an object is  not found in the database.</h2>
<h2>It is recommended that we should use load() method only when we  are sure that object exists in database.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>262.	When should we use get()  method or load() method in  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>As a thumb rule we can follow these guidelines:</p>
<p>We should use get() method when we want to load an object.</p>
<p>We should use load() method when we need a reference to an object  without running extra SQL queries.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>263.	What is a derived property in  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<h2>In Hibernate, a derived property is not mapped to any column of a  database table.</h2>
<h2>A derived property is computed at runtime by evaluation of an  expression.</h2>
<h2>These are read only properties.</h2>
<h2>Egg. In this example profitMargin is derived from salePrice and  buyPrice.</h2>
<h2>&lt;property name=&quot;profitMargin&quot; formula=&quot;( SELECT (i.salePrice –  i.buyPrice) FROM item i WHERE i.Id = Id)&quot;/&gt;</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>264.	How can we use Named Query  in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>A Named SQL query is the HQL query that is associated with a  string name and can be referenced in the application by name.</p>
<p>It can be used in following ways:</p>
<p>XML Mapping File: We can define it in XML mapping file.</p>
<p>Egg.</p>
<p>&lt;query name=&quot;findBookByAuthor”&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;![CDATA[from Book s where s.author = :author]]&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/query&gt;</p>
<p>Annotation: We can also mark Named SQL with annotation.  @NamedQueries({</p>
<p>@NamedQuery(</p>
<p>name = &quot;findBookByAuthor”,</p>
<p>query = &quot;from Book s where s.author = :author”</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>})</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>265.	What are the two locking  strategies in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>There are two popular locking strategies that can be used in  Hibernate:</p>
<p>Optimistic: In Optimistic locking we assume that multiple  transactions can complete without affecting each other. So we let the  transactions do their work without locking the resources initially.</p>
<p>Just before the commit, we check if any of the resource has changed  by another transaction, then we throw exception and rollback the  transaction.</p>
<p>Pessimistic: In Pessimistic locking we assume that concurrent  transactions will conflict while working with same resources. So a  transaction has to first obtain lock on the resources it wants to  update.</p>
<p>The other transaction can proceed with same resource only after the  lock has been released by previous transaction.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>266.	What is the use of version  number in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Version number is used in optimistic locking in Hibernate. When a  transaction modifies an object, it increments its version. Based on  version number, second transaction can determine if the object it has  read earlier has changed or not.</p>
<p>If the version number at the time of write is different than the  version number at the time of read, then we should not commit the  transaction.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>267.	What is the use of  session.lock() method in Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Session.lock() is a deprecated method in Hibernate. We should not  use it.</p>
<p>Instead	we	should	call  buildLockRequest(LockMode).lock(entityName, object) method in  Hibernate.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>268.	What inheritance mapping  strategies are supported by  Hibernate?</b></h1>
<p>Hibernate supports following inheritance mapping strategies  between classes and tables:</p>
<p>Table per class hierarchy: In case of multiple types of books, we  can have one book class and one book table. We can store all child  classes of book like- HardCoverBook, PaperBackBook etc in same  table book. But we can identify the subclasses by a BookType  column in Book table.</p>
<p>Table per subclass: In this case we can have separate table for each  kind of book. HardCoverBook table for  HardCoverBook book  class. PaperBackBook table for PaperBackBook book class. And  there will be a parent table, Book for Book class.</p>
<p>Table per concrete class: In this case also we have separate table  for each kind of book. But in this case we have even inherited  properties defined inside each table. There is no parent table Book  for Book class, since it is not a concrete class.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Maven</b></h1>
<p><b>269.	What is Maven?</b></p>
<p>Maven is a software project management tool. It is open source  software from Apache software foundation.</p>
<p>It is used for building, reporting and documenting a Software  project. It is mainly based on POM (Project Object Model).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>270.	What are the main features of  Maven?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the main features of Maven are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Simple</b>: Maven provides simple project setup that is based  on best practices.</li>
<li><b>Fast</b>: You can get a new project or module started in a few  seconds in Maven.</li>
<li><b>Easy to learn</b>: Maven usage and commands are easy to  learn across all projects. Therefore ramp up time for new  developers coming onto a project is very less.</li>
<li><b>Dependency management</b>: Maven provides superior  dependency management including automatic updates and  transitive dependencies.</li>
<li><b>Multiple Projects</b>: You can easily work with multiple  projects at the same time by using Maven.</li>
<li><b>Large Library</b>: Maven has a large and growing repository  of libraries and metadata to use out of the box.</li>
<li><b>Extensible</b>: Maven supports the ability to easily write  plugins in Java or scripting languages for extending its  core functionality.</li>
<li><b>Instant</b>: Maven is online and it provides instant access to  new features with very less configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>271.What areas of a Project can you  manage by using Maven?</b></h1>
<p>Maven can help us manage following areas of a project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>Reporting</li>
<li>Software Change Management (SCM)</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Distribution</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>272.	What are the main advantages  of Maven?</b></h1>
<p>Maven has a long list of advantages for Software development.  Some of the main advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Common Project Structure</b>: By using Maven, every  developer has a common project structure that helps in  understanding the code as well as developing new features  in a new project.</li>
<li><b>Modular Design</b>: Maven promotes modular design that  divides a complex project into multiple modules that are  easier to manage. By using Maven, it is easier to manage  multiple modules for build, test, release etc.</li>
<li><b>Centralized Dependency Management</b>:  With Maven,  each developer does not have to include the jars separately  in each project or module. Maven provides a centralized  dependency management that can help improve efficiency  of software development.</li>
<li><b>Fewer Decisions</b>: With Maven a developer has to make  fewer decisions about things unrelated to software  development work. The project structure comes ready with  Maven, dependency management is a uniform approach  and build/release are handled by Maven. So a developer  can focus on core work of developing software.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>273.	Why do we say “Maven uses  convention over configuration”?</b></h1>
<p>Convention over configuration is a Software Design Paradigm that  decreases the number of decisions made by a software developer,  without losing flexibility.</p>
<p>In Maven, there are many conventions for setting up the project,  building the artifacts, running unit tests and releasing the code.  These conventions lead to common process  for Software  development.</p>
<p>In case of other tools, there are a lot of configuration options are  present. But most of the time, a developer uses same set of  configuration options. So it is better to make these as a default  options. Maven uses default options from best practices and  provides right conventions for Software development.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>274.	What are the responsibilities of  a Build tool like Maven?</b></h1>
<p>A Build tool like Maven helps us with following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Source Code</b>: A Build tool can generate source code  based on templates.</li>
<li><b>Documentation</b>: We can get documentation files from  source code by using a build tool. E.g. Javadoc</li>
<li><b>Compilation</b>: Primary responsibility of a Build tool is to  compile source code into executable code.</li>
<li><b>Packaging</b>: A Build tool packages compiled code into a  deployable file like- jar, zip war etc.</li>
<li><b>Deployment</b>: We can deploy the packaged code on server  by using a Build tool.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>275.	What are the differences  between Ant and Maven?</b></h1>
<p>Key differences between Ant and Maven are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ant is a Java library and command line toolbox for build  process. Maven is a framework for many aspects of  software development like- project setup, compile, build,  documentation etc.</li>
<li>Ant does not have any conventions for project structure or  build processes. Maven has conventions for setting up  project structure as well as for build processes.</li>
<li>Ant is based on procedural programming. We have to write  code for compilation build, copy etc. Maven is based on  declarative programming. We have to just configure it for  our project setup and programming.</li>
<li>Ant does not impose any lifecycle. We need to create the  sequence of tasks manually. Maven has a lifecycle for  software build processes. There are well-defined phases  that we can use in Maven.</li>
<li>Ant scripts are not reusable in multiple projects. Maven  has plugins that are reusable across multiple projects.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>276.	What is MOJO in Maven?</b></h1>
<p>MOJO stands for Maven plain Old Java Object.</p>
<p>Every MOJO is an executable goal in Maven. It is like an annotated  Java class. It specifies metadata about a goal like- goal name, phase  of lifecycle for goal and parameters required by goal.</p>
<p>A Maven plugin can contain multiple MOJOs.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>277.	What is a Repository in  Maven?</b></h1>
<p>A repository is a location on file system where build artifacts, jars,  dependencies and pom.xml files are stored.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>278.	What are the different types of  repositories in Maven?</b></h1>
<p>There are mainly two types of repositories in Maven:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Local Repository</b>: This is your local folder in which a  copy of your installation and dependencies is stored.</li>
<li><b>Remote Repository</b>: This is a remote folder in which jars  and other build artifacts are stored. These can be located  on servers within your organization.</li>
<li><b>Central Remote Repository</b>: This is the central Maven  repository that is located on repo.maven.apache.org or  uk.maven.org or any other third party location. This where  we can find artifacts from different providers that are  available for download and use. Like- Hibernate, Spring  libraries etc.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>279.	What is a local repository in  Maven?</b></h1>
<p>Maven local repository is a folder in your local files system in  which your project’s installation, dependency jars, plugins etc. are  stored.</p>
<p>Default location of Maven local repository is .m2 folder. It can be  located under following location on file system:</p>
<p>Windows – C:\Documents and Settings\{ username}\.m2  Unix/Linux/Mac – ~/.m2</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>280.	What is a central repository in  Maven?</b></h1>
<h2>Maven central repository is a truly remote repository that is located  on repo.maven.apache.org or uk.maven.org or any other third party  location.</h2>
<h2>This contains the jars and artifacts provided by various software  providers.</h2>
<h2>Central repository contains a large amount of data. Therefore it is  not allowed to scrape the whole site. But you can use the relevant  jars that you want for download and use in your Maven project.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>281.	What is a Remote repository  in Maven?</b></h1>
<p>A Remote repository is a remote location on the internet where the  jars and dependencies from different vendors are stored.</p>
<p>These files can be accessed by protocols like- file:// or http:// etc.</p>
<p>These can be truly remote repositories set up by third party vendors  or locations inside your organization that contains the relevant jars  required by your project.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>282. Why we should not store jars  in CVS or any other version control  system instead of Maven repository?</b></h1>
<p>Maven recommends storing jars in local repository instead of CVS  or any other version control system. There are following advantages  of storing it in Maven repo vs. CVS:</p>
<p>Less Storage: A repository is very large, but it takes less space  because each JAR is stored only in one place. E.g. If we have 10  modules dependent on Spring jar, then they all refer to same Spring  jar stored in local repository.</p>
<p>Quicker Checkout: Project checkout is quicker from local  repository, since there is not need to checkout jars if they are  already present in repo.</p>
<p>No need for versioning: There is no need to version JARS since  external dependencies do not change so often.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>283.	Can anyone upload JARS or  artifacts to Central Repository?</b></h1>
<p>No, we need special permissions to upload JARS and artifacts to  Central Maven Repository?</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>284.	What is a POM?</b></h1>
<p>POM is an abbreviation for Project Object Model. This is the basic  unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file with name pom.xml.</p>
<p>It contains details of project and project configuration that are used  by Maven to build the project.</p>
<p>It also contains default values for many projects. E.g. target is the  name of build directory for Java Maven project.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>285.	What is Super POM?</b></h1>
<p>Super POM is Maven’s default POM. All the POM files extend  from Super POM.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>286.	What are the main required  elements in POM file?</b></h1>
<p>Every POM file should have following required elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>project root</li>
<li>modelVersion</li>
<li>groupID: the id of the project's group.</li>
<li>artifactID: the id of the artifact (project)</li>
<li>version: the version of the artifact under the specified  group</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>287.	What are the phases in Build  lifecycle in Maven?</b></h1>
<p>In Maven, each build lifecycle consists of many phases. Default  build lifecycle has following phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>validate</b>: In this phase, Maven validates that the project is  correct and all necessary information is available to run  next phase.</li>
<li><b>compile</b>: Maven compiles the source code of the project in  this phase.</li>
<li><b>test</b>: This is the phase to run unit tests on the compiled  source. There should not be any need to package or deploy  the code to run these tests.</li>
<li><b>package</b>: In this phase, Maven takes the compiled code  and packages it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.</li>
<li><b>verify</b>: Maven runs any checks on results of integration  tests to ensure that quality criteria are met.</li>
<li><b>install</b>: In this phase, Maven installs the package into local  repository. After this it can be used as a dependency in  other projects locally.</li>
<li><b>deploy</b>: In the build environment, Maven copies the final  package to the remote repository for sharing with other  developers and projects.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>288.	What command will you use to  package your Maven project?</b></h1>
<p>To package a project into a distributable format we use following  command:</p>
<p>mvn -package</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>289.	What is the format of fully  qualified artifact name of a Maven  project?</b></h1>
<p>A Maven project has artifact name with following format:</p>
<p>&lt;groupId&gt;:&lt;artifactId&gt;:&lt;version&gt;</p>
<p>Following is the convention used by some organizations:</p>
<p>Parent pom</p>
<p>groupId: org.Orgname.Projectname  artifactId: org.Orgname.Projectname  version: x.x.x</p>
<p>E.g. org.Orgname.Projectname:org.Orgname.Projectname-1.0.0.pom  Modules</p>
<p>groupId: org.Orgname.Projectname</p>
<p>artifactId: org.Orgname.Projectname.Modulename  version: x.x.x</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>org.Orgname.Projectname:org.Orgname.Projectname.Modulename-  1.0.0.jar</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>290.	What is an Archetype in  Maven?</b></h1>
<p>As per official definition, an Archetype is a Maven project  templating toolkit.</p>
<p>By using an Archetype, an author of Archetype can create a Project  template. Users of this project template (archetype) can pass  different parameters to this template and start using it.</p>
<p>Archetype promotes consistency in the process of creating and  working on a project. It also helps in reducing the ramp up time for  new developers to come on board on a project.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>291.What is the command in Maven  to generate an Archetype?</b></h1>
<p>In	Maven,	we	can	use	following	command	to	generate	an  Archetype:</p>
<p>mvn archetype:generate</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>292.	What are the three main build  lifecycles of Maven?</b></h1>
<h2>Maven has following three build lifecycles that further contain  multiple phases:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>clean</b>: In this lifecycle any files generated by previous  builds are removed.</li>
<li><b>default</b>: This lifecycle is used for validating, compiling  and creating the application. It has multiple phases like-  compile, test, package inside it.</li>
<li><b>site</b>: Maven generates and deploys the documentation of a  site in this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>293.	What are the main uses of a  Maven plugin?</b></h1>
<p>Maven is mainly a plugin execution framework. At the code of  Maven all the work is done by plugins. A Maven plugin can be used  for following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the code</li>
<li>Compiling the code</li>
<li>Creating a JAR file</li>
<li>Deploying the artifacts</li>
<li>Running the unit tests</li>
<li>Documenting the project</li>
<li>Generating the site of a project</li>
<li>Generating a WAR file</li>
<li>Generate a checkstyle report</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>294.	How will you find the version  of a plugin being used?</b></h1>
<p>Maven Help Plugin has a describe goal. This can be used for listing  the version of a plugin. Sample command for this is:</p>
<p>mvn -Dplugin=install help:describe</p>
<p>Note: In the above command replace Dplugin with the plugin prefix  as the argument. Do not use the artifact ID of plugin here.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>295.	What are the different types of  profile in Maven? Where will you  define these profiles?</b></h1>
<p>In Maven, we can have following types of Profile:</p>
<p>Per Project</p>
<p>It is defined in the POM itself (pom.xml).</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>Maven-settings</p>
<p>Per User</p>
<p>We	can	define	it	in  (%USER_HOME%/.m2/settings.xml).</p>
<p>Global</p>
<p>It	is	defined	in	the</p>
<p>global</p>
<p>Maven-settings</p>
<p>(${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml).</p>
<p>Profile descriptor</p>
<p>Descriptor is located in project basedir (profiles.xml) (It is not  supported in Maven 3.0)</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>296.	What are the different setting  files in Maven? Where will you find  these files?</b></h1>
<p>Maven is very simple to use. At the core it has a setting file names  settings.xml. This file contains the setting element that is used to  configure the Maven with different options.</p>
<p>The main locations where this file can be found are:</p>
<p>Maven Installation directory: ${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml  User Home directory: ${user.home}/ .m2 / settings.xml</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>297.	What are the main elements we  can find in settings.xml?</b></h1>
<p>In settings.xml we can have all the configuration information for  Maven. Some of the important elements are:</p>
<p><b>localRepository</b>: The value of this element is the path of this build  system’s local repository. The default value is</p>
<p>${user.home}/.m2/repository.</p>
<p>It is used for a main build server to allow all logged-in users to  build from a common local repository.</p>
<p><b>interactiveMode</b>: If it is true then Maven should attempt to interact  with the user for input. If it is false then Maven does not interact  with the user. Default setting is true.</p>
<p>the  plugin</p>
<p><b>usePluginRegistry</b>:	If	it	is	true	Maven	uses</p>
<p>${user.home}/.m2/plugin-registry.xml	file	to	manage  versions. By defaults it is false.</p>
<p><b>offline</b>: If it is true this build system should be able to operate in  offline mode. By default it is false. This element is used for build  servers that cannot connect to a remote repository due to network  setup or security reasons.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>298.	How will you check the version  of Maven in your system?</b></h1>
<p>We can use following command in console to check the version of  Maven in our system.</p>
<p>mvn -version</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>299.	How will you verify if Maven is  installed on Windows?</b></h1>
<p>To check this, type mvn –version in cmd prompt of Windows. This  will give you the version of Maven installed on Windows.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>300.	What is a Maven artifact?</b></h1>
<p>A Maven artifact is a file that gets deployed to a Maven repository.  In most cases it is a JAR file.</p>
<p>When Maven build runs, it creates one or more artifacts. In case of  Java projects, it produces a compiled jar and a sources jar.</p>
<p>Every artifact in Maven has a group ID, an artifact ID and a version  string. These three attributes uniquely identify an artifact.</p>
<p>In Maven, we specify a project's dependencies as artifacts.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>301.What are the different  dependency scopes in Maven?</b></h1>
<p>Maven supports following dependency scopes:</p>
<p><b>compile</b>: This is the default dependency scope in Maven. The  compile level dependencies are available in all classpaths of a  project. These dependencies are also propagated to dependent  projects.</p>
<p><b>provided</b>: This scope is similar to compile. But in this scope we  expect the JDK or a container to provide the dependency at runtime.</p>
<p>E.g.  While  building  a  web  application  for  the   Java  Enterprise</p>
<p>Edition, we can set the dependency on the Servlet API and related  Java EE APIs to scope provided. The web container will provide  these classes at runtime to our application.</p>
<p>This scope is only available on the compilation and test classpath,  and is not transitive.</p>
<p>runtime:	The	dependency	in	this	scope	is	not	required	for</p>
<p>compilation. It is required for execution. It is available in the  runtime and test classpaths. It is not present in the compile  classpath.</p>
<p><b>test</b>: This scope is used for dependencies that are required for test  compilation and execution phases. This scope is not transitive.</p>
<p><b>system</b>: This scope is same as provided scope, except that you have  to provide the JAR that contains it explicitly. In this case, he artifact  is always available. There is no need to look it up in a repository.</p>
<p><b>import</b>:  This scope is only used on a dependency of type pom in the</p>
<p>&lt;dependencyManagement&gt; section. In this case, the specified POM  has    to    be   replaced  with  the    dependencies    in   that POM's</p>
<p>&lt;dependencyManagement&gt; section. This  scope is only available in</p>
<p>Maven 2.0.9 or later.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>302.	How can we exclude a  dependency in Maven?</b></h1>
<p>To exclude a dependency we can add the &lt;exclusions&gt; tag under the</p>
<p>&lt;dependency&gt; section of the pom.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>&lt;dependencies&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;dependency&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;groupId&gt;test.ProjectX&lt;/groupId&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;artifactId&gt;ProjectX&lt;/artifactId&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;exclusions&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;exclusion&gt; &lt;!-- exclusion is mentioned here --&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;groupId&gt;test.ProjectY&lt;/groupId&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;artifactId&gt;ProjectY&lt;/artifactId&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/exclusion&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/exclusions&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/dependency&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/dependencies&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>303.	How Maven searches for JAR  corresponding to a dependency?</b></h1>
<p>Maven first looks for a JAR related to a dependency in the local  repository. If it finds it there then it stops.</p>
<p>If it does not find it in local repo, it looks for the JAR in the remote  repository and downloads the corresponding version of JAR file.  From remote repository it stores the JAR into local repository.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>304.	What is a transitive</b></h1>
<p><b>dependency in Maven?</b></p>
<p>Let say you have a Project A that depends on dependency B. The  dependency B further depends on dependency C. So your  dependency C is a Transitive Dependency of your project A.</p>
<p>In Maven, starting from 2.0, you do not have to specify transitive  dependencies. You just mention your immediate dependencies in  pom.xml.</p>
<p>Maven takes care of resolving the Transitive dependencies and  includes them automatically.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>305.	What are Excluded  dependencies in Maven?</b></h1>
<p>Let say a project A depends on project B, and project B depends on  project C. The developers of project A can explicitly exclude  project C as a dependency. We can use the &quot;exclusion&quot; element to  exclude it.</p>
<p>Such dependencies are called Excluded dependencies in Maven.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>306.	What are Optional  dependencies in Maven?</b></h1>
<h2>Let say a project B depends on project C. The developers of project  B can mark project C as an optional dependency by using the  &quot;optional&quot; element.</h2>
<h2>In case project A depends on project B, A will depend only on B  and not on B's optional dependency C.</h2>
<h2>The developers of project A may then explicitly add a dependency  on C. The dependency of B on C is known as Optional dependency  in Maven.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>307.	Where will you find the class  files after compiling a Maven project  successfully?</b></h1>
<p>Once Maven completes the compilation successfully, it stores the  files in target folder. The default location for class files is:</p>
<p>${basedir}/target/classes/</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>308.	What are the default locations  for source, test and build directories  in Maven?</b></h1>
<p>The default locations are as follows:</p>
<p>Source: src/main/java  Test: src/main/test  Build: Target</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>309.	What is the result of	jar:jar  goal in Maven?</b></h1>
<p>In Maven, jar:jar goal creates a jar file in the Maven build  directory. Jar file is create with the name format ${project.id}-</p>
<p>${project.currentVersion}.jar.</p>
<p>The id and currentVersion are mentioned in the project.xml of the  project being built.</p>
<p>jar:jar does not recompile sources. It just creates a jar from already  compiled classes.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>310.How can we get the debug or  error messages from the execution of  Maven?</b></h1>
<p>At times, project build or compile fails in Maven. At this time it is  very helpful to see the debug or error messages from Maven  execution.</p>
<p>To get the debug messages we can call Maven with -X option.</p>
<p>To get the error/exception messages we can call Maven with -e  option.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>311. What is the difference between a  Release version and SNAPSHOT  version in Maven?</b></h1>
<h2>A SNAPSHOT version in Maven is the one that has not been  released.</h2>
<h2>Before every release version there is a SNAPSHOT version.  Before 1.0 release there will be 1.0-SNAPSHOT.</h2>
<h2>If we download 1.0-SNAPSHOT today then we may get different  set of files than the one we get on downloading it yesterday.  SNAPSHOT version can keep getting changes in it since it is under  development.</h2>
<h2>But release version always gives exactly same set files with each  download.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>312.How will you run test classes in  Maven?</b></h1>
<p>We need Surefire plugin to run the test classes in Maven.</p>
<p>To run a single test we can call following command:  mvn -Dtest=TestCaseA test</p>
<p>We can also use patterns to run multiple test cases:  mvn -Dtest=TestCase* test</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>mvn -Dtest=TestCaseA,TestCaseB,TestImportant* test</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>313.Sometimes Maven compiles the  test classes but doesn't run them?  What could be the reason for it?</b></h1>
<h2>In Maven, Surefire plugin is used for running the Tests.</h2>
<h2>We can configure it to run certain test classes. Sometimes we you  may have unintentionally specified an incorrect value to ${test} in  settings.xml or pom.xml.</h2>
<h2>We need to look for following in pom.xml/settings.xml and fix it:</h2>
<h2>&lt;properties&gt;</h2>
<h2>&lt;property&gt;</h2>
<h2>&lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;</h2>
<h2>&lt;value&gt;some-value&lt;/value&gt;</h2>
<h2>&lt;/property&gt;</h2>
<h2>&lt;/properties&gt;</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>314.	How can we skip the running  of tests in Maven?</b></h1>
<p>We	can	use	the	parameter	-Dmaven.test.skip=true	or	-  DskipTests=true in the command line for skipping the tests.</p>
<p>The parameter -Dmaven.test.skip=true skips the compilation of  tests.</p>
<p>The parameter -DskipTests=true skips the execution of tests  Surefire plugin of Maven honors these parameters.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>315.Can we create our own directory  structure for a project in Maven?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, Maven gives us the flexibility of creating our own directory  structure.	We	just	need	to	configure	the	elements	like</p>
<p>&lt;sourceDirectory&gt;,   &lt;resources&gt;  etc.   in  the   &lt;build&gt;  section of</p>
<p>pom.xml.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>316.What are the differences between  Gradle and Maven?</b></h1>
<p>Gradle is nowadays getting more popular. Google uses it for  Android development and release. Companies like LinkedIn also  use Gradle.</p>
<p>Gradle is based on Domain Specific Language (DSL). Maven is  based on XML.</p>
<p>Gradle gives more flexibility to do custom tasks similar to ANT.  Maven scripts have predefined structure. So it is less flexible.</p>
<p>Maven is mainly used for Java based systems. Gradle is used for a  variety of languages. It is a Polyglot build tool.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>317.What is the difference between  Inheritance and Multi-module in  Maven?</b></h1>
<p>In Maven, we can create a parent project that will pass its values to  its children projects.</p>
<p>A multi-module project is created to manage a group of other sub-  projects or modules. The multi-module relationship is like a tree  that starts from the topmost level to the bottom level. In a multi-  module project, we specify that a project should  include the  specific modules for build. Multi-module builds are used to group  modules together in a single build.</p>
<p>Whereas in Inheritance, the parent-child project relationship starts  from the leaf node and goes upwards. It deals more with the  definition of a specific project. In this case a child’s pom is derived  from its parent’s pom.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>318.What is Build portability in  Maven?</b></h1>
<p>In Maven, the portability of a build is the measure of how easy it is  to take a particular project and build it in different environments.</p>
<p>A build that does not require any custom  configuration  or  customization of properties files is more portable than a build that  requires a lot of custom work to build it from scratch.</p>
<p>Open source projects from Apache Commons are one of the most  portable projects. These build can work just out of the box.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>GIT</b></h1>
<p><b>319.How can we see n most recent  commits in GIT?</b></p>
<p>We can use git log command to see the latest commits. To see the  three most recent commits we use following command:</p>
<p>git log -3</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>320.	How can we know if a branch  is already merged into master in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>We can use following commands for this purpose:</p>
<p>git  branch --merged master	: This prints the branches merged into  master</p>
<p>git branch --merged lists : This prints the branches merged into  HEAD (i.e. tip of current branch)</p>
<p>git branch --no-merged : This prints the branches that have not been  merged</p>
<p>By default this applies only to local branches.</p>
<p>We can use -a flag to show both local and remote branches.  Or we can use -r flag to show only the remote branches.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>321.What is the purpose of git stash  drop?</b></h1>
<p>In case we do not need a specific stash, we use git stash drop  command to remove it from the list of stashes.</p>
<p>By default, this command removes to latest added stash</p>
<p>To remove a specific stash we specify as argument in the git stash  drop &lt;stashname&gt; command.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>322.	What is the HEAD in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>A HEAD is a reference to the currently checked out commit.</p>
<p>It is a symbolic reference to the branch that we have checked out.</p>
<p>At any given time, one head is selected as the ‘current head’ This  head is also known as HEAD (always in uppercase).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>323.	What is the most popular  branching strategy in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>There are many ways to do branching in GIT. One of the popular  ways is to maintain two branches:</p>
<p>master: This branch is used for production. In this branch HEAD is  always in production ready state.</p>
<p>develop: This branch is used for development. In this branch we  store the latest code developed in project. This is work in progress  code.</p>
<p>Once the code is ready for deployment to production, it is merged  into master branch from develop branch.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>324.	What is SubGit?</b></h1>
<p>SubGit is software tool used for migrating SVN to Git. It is very  easy to use. By using this we can create a writable Git mirror of a  Subversion repository.</p>
<p>It creates a bi-directional mirror that can be used for pushing to Git  as well as committing to Subversion.</p>
<p>SubGit also takes care  of synchronization between Git and  Subversion.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>325.	What is the use of git  instaweb?</b></h1>
<p>Git-instaweb is a script by which we can browse a git repository in  a web browser.</p>
<p>It sets up the gitweb and a web-server that makes the working  repository available online.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>326.	What are git hooks?</b></h1>
<p>Git hooks are scripts that can run automatically on the occurrence of  an event in a Git repository. These are used for automation of  workflow in GIT.</p>
<p>Git hooks also help in customizing the internal behavior of GIT.  These are generally used for enforcing a GIT commit policy.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>327.	What is GIT?</b></h1>
<p>GIT is a mature Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). It is  used for Source Code Management (SCM).</p>
<p>It is open source software. It was developed by Linus Torvalds, the  creator of Linux operating system.</p>
<p>GIT	works	well	with	a	large	number	of	IDEs	(Integrated  Development Environments) like- Eclipse, InteliJ etc.</p>
<p>GIT can be used to handle small and large projects.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>328.	What is a repository in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>A repository in GIT is the place in which we store our software  work.</p>
<p>It contains a sub-directory called .git. There is only one .git  directory in the root of the project.</p>
<p>In .git, GIT stores all the metadata for the repository. The contents  of .git directory are of internal use to GIT.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>329.	What are the main benefits of  GIT?</b></h1>
<p>There are following main benefits of GIT:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed System: GIT is a Distributed Version Control  System (DVCS). So you can keep your private work in  version control but completely hidden from others. You  can work offline as well.</li>
<li>Flexible Workflow: GIT allows you to create your own</li>
<p>workflow. You can use the process that is suitable for your  project. You can go for centralized or master-slave or any  other workflow.</p>
<li>Fast: GIT is very fast when compared to other version</li>
<p>control systems.</p>
<li>Data Integrity: Since GIT uses SHA1, data is not easier to  corrupt.</li>
<li>Free: It is free for personal use. So many amateurs use it</li>
<p>for their initial projects. It also works very well with large  size project.</p>
<li>Collaboration: GIT is very easy to use for projects in</li>
<p>which collaboration is required. Many popular open  source software across the globe use GIT.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>330.	What are the disadvantages of  GIT?</b></h1>
<p>GIT has very few disadvantages. These are the scenarios when GIT  is difficult to use. Some of these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binary Files: If we have a lot binary files (non-text) in our  project, then GIT becomes very slow. E.g. Projects with a  lot of images or Word documents.</li>
<li>Steep Learning Curve: It takes some time for a newcomer</li>
<p>to learn GIT. Some of the GIT commands are non-intuitive  to a fresher.</p>
</ul>
<p>3.	Slow	remote</p>
<p>speed:	Sometimes	the	use	of	remote</p>
<p>repositories in slow due to network latency. Still GIT is  better than other VCS in speed.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>331.What are the main differences  between GIT and SVN?</b></h1>
<p>The main differences between GIT and SVN are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized: GIT is decentralized. You have a local  copy that is a repository in which you can commit. In SVN  you have to always connect to a central repository for  check-in.</li>
<li>Complex to learn: GIT is a bit difficult to learn for some  developers. It has more concepts and commands to learn.  SVN is much easier to learn.</li>
<li>Unable to handle Binary files: GIT becomes slow when it  deals with large binary files that change frequently. SVN  can handle large binary files easily.</li>
<li>Internal directory: GIT creates only .git directory. SVN  creates .svn directory in each folder.</li>
<li>User Interface: GIT does not have good UI. But SVN has  good user interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>332.	How will you start GIT for  your project?</b></h1>
<p>We use git init command in an existing project directory to start  version control for our project.</p>
<p>After this we can use git add and git commit commands to add files  to our GIT repository.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>333.	What is git clone in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, we use git clone command to create a copy of an existing  GIT repository in our local.</p>
<p>This is the most popular way to create a copy of the repository  among developers.</p>
<p>It is similar to svn checkout. But in this case the working copy is a  full-fledged repository.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>334.	How will you create a  repository in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>To create a new repository in GIT, first we create a directory for the  project. Then we run ‘git init’ command.</p>
<p>Now, GIT creates .git directory in our project directory. This is  how our new GIT repository is created.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>335.	What are the different ways to  start work in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>We can start work in GIT in following ways:</p>
<p>New Project: To create a new repository we use git init command.</p>
<p>Existing Project: To work on an existing repository we use git clone  command.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>336.	GIT is written in which  language?</b></h1>
<p>Most of the GIT distributions are written in C language with Bourne  shell. Some of the commands are written in Perl language.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>337.	What does ‘git pull’ command  in GIT do internally?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, git pull internally does a git fetch first and then does a git  merge.</p>
<p>So pull is a combination of two commands: fetch and merge.</p>
<p>We use git pull command to bring our local branch up to date with  its remote version.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>338.	What does ‘git push’ command  in GIT do internally?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, git push command does following two commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>fetch</b>: First GIT, copies all the extra commits from server  into local repo and moves origin/master branch pointer to  the end of commit chain.</li>
<li><b>merge</b>: Then it merges the origin/master branch into the  master branch. Now the master branch pointer moves to  the newly created commit. But the origin/master pointer  remains there.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>339.	What is git stash?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, sometimes we do not want to commit our code but we do not  want to lose also the unfinished code. In this case we use git stash  command to record the current state of the working directory and  index in a stash. This stores the unfinished work in a stash, and  cleans the current branch from uncommitted changes.</p>
<p>Now we can work on a clean working directory.</p>
<p>Later we can use the stash and apply those changes back to our  working directory.</p>
<p>At times we are in the middle of some work and do not want to lose  the unfinished work, we use git stash command.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>340.	What is the meaning of ‘stage’  in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, stage is a step before commit. To stage means that the files  are ready for commit.</p>
<p>Let say, you are working on two features in GIT. One of the features  is finished and the other is not yet ready. You want to commit and  leave for home in the evening. But you can commit since both of  them are not fully ready. In this case you can just stage the feature  that is ready and commit that part. Second feature will remain as  work in progress.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>341.	What is the purpose of git  config command?</b></h1>
<p>We can set the configuration options for GIT installation by using git  config command.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>342.	How can we see the  configuration settings of GIT  installation?</b></h1>
<p>We can use ‘git config --list’ command to print all the GIT  configuration settings in GIT installation.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>343.	How will you write a message  with commit command in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>We call following command for commit with a message:</p>
<p>$/&gt; git commit –m &lt;message&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>344.	What is stored inside a commit  object in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>GIT commit object contains following information:</p>
<p>SHA1 name: A 40 character string to identify a commit</p>
<p>Files: List of files that represent the state of a project at a specific  point of time</p>
<p>Reference: Any reference to parent commit objects</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>345.	How many heads can you  create in a GIT repository?</b></h1>
<p>There can be any number of heads in a repository.</p>
<p>By default there is one head known as HEAD in each repository in  GIT.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>346.	Why do we create branches in  GIT?</b></h1>
<h2>If we are simultaneously working on multiple tasks, projects,  defects or features, we need multiple branches. In GIT we can  create a separate branch for each separate purpose.</h2>
<h2>Let say we are working on a feature, we create a feature branch for  that. In between we get a defect to work on then we create another  branch for defect and work on it. Once the defect work is done, we  merge that branch and come back to work on feature branch again.</h2>
<h2>So working on multiple tasks is the main reason for using multiple  branches.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>347.	What are the different kinds of  branches that can be created in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>We can create different kinds of branches for following purposes in  GIT:</p>
<p>Feature branches: These are used for developing a feature.</p>
<p>Release branches: These are used for releasing code to production.</p>
<p>Hotfix branches: These are used for releasing a hotfix to production  for a defect or emergency fix.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>348.	How will you create a new  branch in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>We use following command to create a new branch in GIT:</p>
<p>$/&gt; git checkout –b &lt;branchname&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>349.	How will you add a new feature  to the main branch?</b></h1>
<p>We do the development work on a feature branch that is created  from master branch. Once the development work is ready we use git  merge command to merge it into master branch.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>350.	What is a pull request in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>A pull request in GIT is the list of changes that have been pushed to  GIT repository. Generally these changes are pushed in a feature  branch or hotfix branch. After pushing these changes we create a  pull request that contains the changes between master and our  feature branch. This pull request is sent to reviewers for reviewing  the code and then merging it into develop or release branch.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>351.What is merge conflict in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>A merge conflict in GIT is the result of merging two commits.  Sometimes the commit to be merged and current commit have  changes in same location. In this scenario, GIT is not able to decide  which change is more important. Due to this GIT reports a merge  conflict. It means merge is not successful. We may have to manually  check and resolve the merge conflict.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>352.	How can we resolve a merge  conflict in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>When GIT reports merge conflict in a file, it marks the lines as  follows:</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>the business days in this week are</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</p>
<p>five</p>
<p>=======</p>
<p>six</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-feature</p>
<p>To resolve the merge conflict in a file, we edit the file and fix the  conflicting change. In above example we can either keep five or six.</p>
<p>After editing the file we run git add command followed by git  commit command. Since GIT is aware that it was merge conflict, it  links this change to the correct commit.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>353.	What command will you use to  delete a branch?</b></h1>
<p>After the successful merge of feature branch in main branch, we do  not need the feature branch.</p>
<p>To delete an unwanted branch we use following command:  git branch –d &lt;branchname&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>354.	What command will you use to  delete a branch that has unmerged  changes?</b></h1>
<p>To forcibly delete an unwanted branch with unmerged changes, we  use following command:</p>
<p>git branch –D &lt;branchname&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>355.	What is the alternative  command to merging in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>Another alternative of merging in GIT is rebasing. It is done by git  rebase command.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>356.	What is Rebasing in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>Rebasing is the process of moving a branch to a new base commit.  It is like rewriting the history of a branch.</p>
<p>In Rebasing, we move a branch from one commit to another. By this  we can maintain linear project history.</p>
<p>Once the commits are pushed to a public repository, it is not a good  practice to use Rebasing.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>357.	What is the ‘Golden Rule of  Rebasing’ in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>The golden rule of Rebasing is that we should never use git rebase  on public branches. If other people are using the same branch then  they may get confused by looking at the changes in Master branch  after GIT rebasing.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not recommended to do rebasing on a public branch  that is also used by other collaborators.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>358.	Why do we use Interactive  Rebasing in place of Auto Rebasing?</b></h1>
<p>By using Interactive rebasing we can alter the commits before  moving them to a new branch.</p>
<p>This is more powerful than an automated rebase. It gives us  complete control over the branch’s commit history.</p>
<p>Generally, we use Interactive Rebasing to clean up the messy  history of commits just before merging a feature branch into master.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>359.	What is the command for  Rebasing in Git?</b></h1>
<p>Git command for rebasing is:</p>
<p>git rebase &lt;new-commit&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>360.	What is the main difference  between git clone and git remote?</b></h1>
<p>The main difference between git clone and git remote is that git  clone is used to create a new local repository whereas git remote is  used in an existing repository.</p>
<p>git remote adds a new reference to existing remote repository for  tracking further changes.</p>
<p>git clone creates a new local repository by copying another  repository from a URL.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>361.What is GIT version control?</b></h1>
<p>GIT version control helps us in managing the changes to source  code over time by a software team. It keeps track of all the changes  in a special kind of database. If we make a mistake, we can go back  in time and see previous changes to fix the mistake.</p>
<p>GIT version control helps the team in collaborating on developing a  software and work efficiently. Every one can merge the changes  with confidence that everything is tracked and remains intact in GIT  version control. Any bug introduced by a change can be discovered  and reverted back by going back to a working version.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>362.	What GUI do you use for  working on GIT?</b></h1>
<p>There are many GUI for GIT that we can use. Some of these are:</p>
<p>GitHub Desktop  GITX-dev  Gitbox</p>
<p>Git-cola</p>
<p>SourceTree  Git Extensions  SmartGit  GitUp</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>363.	What is the use of git diff  command in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, git diff command is used to display the differences between  2 versions, or between working directory and an index, or between  index and most recent commit.</p>
<p>It can also display changes between two blob objects, or between  two files on disk in GIT.</p>
<p>It helps in finding the changes that can be used for code review for a  feature or bug fix.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>364.	What is git rerere?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, rerere is a hidden feature. The full form of rerere is “reuse  recorded resolution”.</p>
<p>By using rerere, GIT remembers  how we’ve resolved a hunk  conflict. The next time GIT sees  the same conflict, it can  automatically resolve it for us.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>365.	What are the three most  popular version of git diff command?</b></h1>
<h2>Three most popular git diff commands are as follows:</h2>
<h2>git diff: It displays the differences between working directory and  the index.</h2>
<h2>git diff –cached: It displays the differences between the index and  the most recent commit.</h2>
<h2>git  diff  HEAD:	It  displays	the	differences	between working  directory and the most recent commit</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>366.	What is the use of git status  command?</b></h1>
<h2>In GIT, git status command mainly shows the status of working tree.</h2>
<h2>It shows following items:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The paths that have differences between the index file and  the current HEAD commit.</li>
<li>The paths that have differences between the working tree  and the index file</li>
<li>The paths in the working tree that are not tracked by GIT.</li>
<h2>Among the above three items, first item is the one that we commit by  using git commit command. Item two and three can be committed  only after running git add command.</h2>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>367.	What is the main difference  between git diff and git status?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, git diff shows the differences between different commits or  between the working directory and index.</p>
<p>Whereas, git status command just shows the current status of  working tree.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>368.	What is the use of git rm  command in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, git rm command  is used for removing a file from the  working tree and the index.</p>
<p>We use git rm –r to recursively remove all files from a leading  directory.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>369.	What is the command to apply  a stash?</b></h1>
<h2>Sometimes we want to save our unfinished work. For this purpose  we use git stash command. Once we want to come back and  continue working from the last place where we left, we use git stash  apply command to bring back the unfinished work.</h2>
<h2>So the command to apply a stash is:  git stash apply</h2>
<h2>Or we can use</h2>
<h2>git stash apply &lt;stashname&gt;</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>370.	Why do we use git log  command?</b></h1>
<p>We use git log command to search for specific commits in project  history.</p>
<p>We can search git history by author, date or content. It can even list  the commits that were done x days before or after a specific date.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>371.Why do we need git add  command in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>GIT gives us a very good feature of staging our changes before  commit. To stage the changes we use git add command. This adds  our changes from working directory to the index.</p>
<p>When we are working on multiple tasks and we want to just commit  the finished tasks, we first add finished changes to staging area and  then commit it. At this time git add command is very helpful.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>372.	Why do we use git reset  command?</b></h1>
<p>We use git reset command to reset current HEAD to a specific state.  By default it reverses the action of git add command.</p>
<p>So we use git reset command to undo the changes of git add  command.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>373.	What does a commit object  contain?</b></h1>
<p>Whenever we do a commit in GIT by using git commit command,  GIT creates a new commit object. This commit objects is saved to  GIT repository.</p>
<p>The commit object contains following information:</p>
<p>HASH: The SHA1 hash of the Git tree that refers to the state of  index at commit time.</p>
<p>Commit Author: The name of person/process doing the commit and</p>
<p>date/time.</p>
<p>Comment: Some text messages that contains the reason for the  commit .</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>374.	How can we convert git log  messages to a different format?</b></h1>
<p>We can use pretty option in git log command for this.</p>
<p>git log – pretty</p>
<p>This option converts the output format from default to other formats.  There are pre-built formats available for our use.</p>
<p>git log –pretty=oneline</p>
<p>E.g. git log --pretty=format:&quot;%h - %an, %ar : %s&quot;</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>375.	What are the programming  languages in which git hooks can be  written?</b></h1>
<p>Git hooks are generally written in shell and PERL scripts. But these  can be written in any other language as long as it has an executable.</p>
<p>Git hooks can also be written in Python script.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>376.	What is a commit message in  GIT?</b></h1>
<p>A commit message is a comment that we add to a commit. We can  provide meaningful information about the reason for commit by  using a commit message.</p>
<p>In most of the organizations,  it is mandatory to put a commit  message along with each commit.</p>
<p>Often, commit messages contain JIRA ticket, bug id, defect id etc.  for a project.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>377.	How GIT protects the code in  a repository?</b></h1>
<p>GIT is made very secure since it contains the source code of an  organization. All the objects in a GIT repository are encrypted with  a hashing algorithm called SHA1.</p>
<p>This algorithm is quite strong and fast. It protects source code and  other contents of repository against the possible malicious attacks.</p>
<p>This algorithm also maintains the integrity of GIT repository by  protecting the change history against accidental changes.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>378.	How GIT provides flexibility in  version control?</b></h1>
<p>GIT is very flexible version control system. It supports non-linear  development workflows. It supports flows that are compatible with  external protocols and existing systems.</p>
<p>GIT also supports both branching and tagging that promotes multiple  kinds of workflows in version control.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>379.	How can we change a commit  message in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>If a commit has not been pushed to GitHub, we can use git commit --  ammend command to change the commit message.</p>
<p>When we push the commit, a new message appears on GitHub.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>380.	Why is it advisable to create an  additional commit instead of  amending an existing commit?</b></h1>
<p>Git amend internally creates a new commit and replaces the old  commit. If commits have already been pushed to central repository,  it should not be used to modify the previous commits.</p>
<p>It should be generally used for only amending the git comment.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>381.What is a bare repository in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>A repository created with git init –bare command is a bare  repository in GIT.</p>
<p>The bare repository does not contain any working or checked out  copy of source files. A bare repository stores git revision history in  the root folder of repository instead of in a .git subfolder.</p>
<p>It is mainly used for sharing and collaborating with other  developers.</p>
<p>We can create a bare repository in which all developers can push  their code.</p>
<p>There is no working tree in bare repository, since no one directly  edits files in a bare repository.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>382.	How do we put a local  repository on GitHub server?</b></h1>
<p>To put a local repository on GitHub, we first add all the files of  working directory into local repository and commit the changes.  After that we call git remote add &lt;Remote Repo URL&gt; command to  add the local repository on GitHub server.</p>
<p>Once it is added, we use git push command to push the contents of  local repository to remote GitHub server.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>383.	How will you delete a branch  in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>We use git branch –d &lt;branchname&gt; command to delete a branch in  GIT.</p>
<p>In case a local branch is not fully merged, but we want to delete it  by force, then we use git branch –D &lt;branchname&gt; command.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>384.	How can we set up a Git  repository to run code sanity checks  and UAT tests just before a commit?</b></h1>
<p>We can use git hooks for this kind of purpose. We can write the code  sanity checks in script. This script can be called by pre-commit  hook of the repository.</p>
<p>If this hook passes, then only commit will be successful.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>385. How can we revert a commit  that was pushed earlier and is public  now?</b></h1>
<p>We can use git revert command for this purpose.</p>
<p>Internally, git revert command creates a new commit with patches  that reverse the changes done in previous commits.</p>
<p>The other option is to checkout a previous commit version and then  commit it as a new commit.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>386.	In GIT, how will you compress  last n commits into a single commit?</b></h1>
<p>Tom compress last n commits a single commit, we use git rebase  command. This command compresses multiple commits and creates  a new commit. It overwrites the history of commits.</p>
<p>It should be done carefully, since it can lead to unexpected results.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>387.	How will you switch from one  branch to a new branch in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, we can use git checkout &lt;new branchname&gt; command to  switch to a new branch.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>388. How can we clean unwanted  files from our working directory in  GIT?</b></h1>
<p>GIT provides git clean command to recursively clean the working  tree. It removes the files that are not under version control in GIT.</p>
<p>If we use git clean –x, then ignored files are also removed.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>389.	What is the purpose of git tag  command?</b></h1>
<p>We use git tag command to add, delete, list or verify a tag object in  GIT.</p>
<p>Tag objects created with options –a, -s, -u are also known as  annotated tags.</p>
<p>Annotated tags are generally used for release.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>390.	What is cherry-pick in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>A git cherry-pick is a very useful feature in GIT. By using this  command we can selectively apply the changes done by existing  commits.</p>
<p>In case we want to selectively release a feature, we can remove the  unwanted files and apply only selected commits.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>391.What is shortlog in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>A shortlog in GIT is a command that summarizes the git log output.</p>
<p>The output of git shortlog is in a format suitable for release  announcements.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>392.	How can you find the names of  files that were changed in a specific  commit?</b></h1>
<h2>Every commit in GIT has a hash code. This hash code uniquely  represents the GIT commit object.</h2>
<h2>We can use git diff-tree command to list the name of files that were  changed in a commit.</h2>
<h2>The command will be as follows:  git diff-tree -r &lt;hash of commit&gt;</h2>
<h2>By using -r flag, we just get the list of individual files.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>393.	How can we attach an  automated script to run on the event  of a new commit by push command?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT we can use a hook to run an automated script on a specific  event. We can choose between pre-receive, update or post-receive  hook and attach our script on any of these hooks.</p>
<p>GIT will automatically run the script on the event of any of these  hooks.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>394.	What is the difference between  pre-receive, update and post-receive  hooks in GIT?</b></h1>
<h2>Pre-receive hook is invoked when a commit is pushed to a  destination repository. Any script attached to this hook is executed  before updating any reference. This is mainly used to enforce  development best practices and policies.</h2>
<h2>Update hook is similar to pre-receive hook. It is triggered just  before any updates are done. This hook is invoked once for every  commit that is pushed to a destination repository.</h2>
<h2>Post-receive hook is invoked after the updates have been done and  accepted by a destination repository. This is mainly used to  configure deployment scripts. It can also invoke Continuous  Integration (CI) systems and send notification emails to relevant  parties of a repository.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>395.	Do we have to store Scripts for  GIT hooks within same repository?</b></h1>
<p>A Hook is local to a GIT repository. But the script attached to a  hook can be created either inside the hooks directory or it can be  stored in a separate repository. But we have to link the script to a  hook in our local repository.</p>
<p>In this way we can maintain versions of a script in a separate  repository, but use them in our repository where hooks are stored.</p>
<p>Also when we store scripts in a separate common repository, we  can reuse same scripts for different purposes in multiple  repositories.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>396.	How can we determine the  commit that is the source of a bug in  GIT?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT we can use git bisect command to find the commit that has  introduced a bug in the system.</p>
<p>GIT bisect command internally uses binary search algorithm to find  the commit that introduced a bug.</p>
<p>We first tell a bad commit that contains the bug and a good commit  that was present before the bug was introduced.</p>
<p>Then git bisect picks a commit between those two endpoints and  asks us whether the selected commit is good or bad.</p>
<p>It continues to narrow down the range until it discovers the exact  commit responsible for introducing the bug.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>397.	How can we see differences  between two commits in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>We can use git diff command to see the differences between two  commits. The syntax for a simple git diff command to compare two  commits is:</p>
<p>git diff &lt;commit#1&gt; &lt;commit#2&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>398.	What are the different ways to  identify a commit in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>Each commit object in GIT has a unique hash. This hash is a 40  characters checksum hash. It is based on SHA1 hashing algorithm.  We can use a hash to uniquely identify a GIT commit.</p>
<p>Git also provides support for creating an alias for a commit. This  alias is known as refs. Every tag in GIT is a ref. These refs can also  be used to identify a commit. Some of the special tags in GIT are  HEAD, FETCH_HEAD and MERGE_HEAD.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>399.	When we run git branch
&lt;branchname&gt;, how does GIT know  the SHA-1 of the last commit?</b></h1>
<p>GIT uses the reference named HEAD for this purpose. The HEAD  file in GIT is a symbolic reference to the current branch we are  working on.</p>
<p>A symbolic reference is not a normal reference that contains a SHA-</p>
<p>1   value.   A   symbolic   reference   contains a  pointer	to another  reference.</p>
<p>When we open head file we see:</p>
<p>$ cat .git/HEAD</p>
<p>ref: refs/heads/master</p>
<p>If we run git checkout branchA, Git updates the file to look like this:</p>
<p>$ cat .git/HEAD</p>
<p>ref: refs/heads/branchA</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>400.	What are the different types of  Tags you can create in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, we can create two types of Tags.</p>
<p>Lightweight Tag: A lightweight tag is a reference that never moves.  We can make a lightweight tag by running a command similar to  following:</p>
<p>$	git	update-ref	refs/tags/v1.0  dad0dab538c970e37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d</p>
<p>Annotated Tag: An annotated tag is more complex object in GIT.  When we create an annotated tag, GIT creates a tag object and  writes a reference to point to it rather than directly to the commit.  We can create an annotated tag as follows:</p>
<p>$ git tag -a v1.1 1d410eabc13591cb07496601ebc7c059dd55bfe9 -  m 'test tag'</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>401.	How can we rename a remote  repository?</b></h1>
<p>We can use command git remote rename for changing the name of a  remote repository. This changes the short name associated with a  remote repository in your local. Command would look as follows:</p>
<p>git remote rename repoOldName repoNewName</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>402.	Some people use git checkout  and some use git co for checkout. How  is that possible?</b></h1>
<h2>We can create aliases in GIT for commands by modifying the git  configuration.</h2>
<h2>In case of calling git co instead of git checkout we can run following  command:</h2>
<h2>git config --global alias.co checkout</h2>
<h2>So the people using git co have made the alias for git checkout in  their own environment.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>403.	How can we see the last  commit on each of our branch in  GIT?</b></h1>
<h2>When we run git branch command, it lists all the branches in our  local repository. To see the latest commit associated with each  branch, we use option –v.</h2>
<h2>Exact command for this is as follows:  git branch –v</h2>
<h2>It lists branches as:</h2>
<h2>issue75 83b576c fix issue</h2>
<h2>* master 7b96605 Merge branch 'issue75'  testing 972ac34 add dave to the developer list</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>404.	Is origin a special branch in  GIT?</b></h1>
<h2>No, origin is not a special branch in GIT.</h2>
<h2>Branch origin is similar to branch master. It does not have any  special meaning in GIT.</h2>
<h2>Master is the default name for a starting branch when we run git init  command.</h2>
<h2>Origin is the default name for a remote when we run git clone  command. If we run git clone -o myOrigin instead, then we will  have myOrigin/master as our default remote branch.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>405.	How can we configure GIT to  not ask for password every time?</b></h1>
<p>When we use HTTPS URL to push, the GIT server asks for  username and password for authentication. It prompts us on the  terminal for this information.</p>
<p>If we don’t want to type username/password with every single time  push, we can set up a “credential cache”.</p>
<p>It is kept in memory for a few minutes. We can set it by running:  git config --global credential.helper cache</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>406.	What are the four major  protocols used by GIT for data  transfer?</b></h1>
<p>GIT uses following major protocols for data transfer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local</li>
<li>HTTP</li>
<li>Secure Shell (SSH)</li>
<li>Git</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>407.	What is GIT protocol?</b></h1>
<p>Git protocol is a mechanism for transferring data in GIT. It is a  special daemon. It comes pre-packaged with GIT. It listens on a  dedicated port 9418. It provides services similar to SSH protocol.</p>
<p>But Git protocol does not support any authentication.</p>
<p>So on plus side, this is a very fast network transfer protocol. But it  lacks authentication.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>408.	How can we work on a project  where we do not have push access?</b></h1>
<p>In case of projects where we do not have push access, we can just  fork the repository. By running git fork command, GIT will create a  personal copy of the repository in our namespace. Once our work is  done, we can create a pull request to merge our changes on the real  project.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>409.	What is git grep?</b></h1>
<p>GIT is shipped along with a grep command that allows us to search  for a string or regular expression in any committed tree or the  working directory.</p>
<p>By default, it works on the files in your current working directory.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>410.	How can your reorder  commits in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>We can use git rebase command to reorder commits in GIT. It can  work interactively and you can also select the ordering of commits.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>411.How will you split a commit into  multiple commits?</b></h1>
<p>To split a commit, we have to use git rebase command in interactive  mode. Once we reach the commit that needs to be split, we reset  that commit and take the changes that have been reset. Now we can  create multiple commits out of that.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>412.	What is filter-branch in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, filter-branch is another option to rewrite history. It can scrub  the entire history. When we have large number of commits, we can  use this tool.</p>
<p>It gives many options like removing the commit related changes to a  specific file from history.</p>
<p>You can even set you name and email in the commit history by using  filter-branch.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>413.	What are the three main trees  maintained by GIT?</b></h1>
<p>GIT maintains following three trees:</p>
<p>HEAD: This is the last commit snapshot.</p>
<p>Index: This is the proposed next commit snapshot.  Working Directory: This is the sandbox for doing changes.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>414.	What are the three main steps  of working GIT?</b></h1>
<p>GIT has following three main steps in a simple workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checkout the project from HEAD to Working Directory.</li>
<li>Stage the files from Working Directory to Index.</li>
<li>Commit the changes from Index to HEAD.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>415.	What are ours and theirs  merge options in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>In	GIT, we get two simple options for resolving merge conflicts:  ours and theirs</p>
<p>These options tell the GIT which side to favor in merge conflicts.  In ours, we run a command like git merge -Xours branchA</p>
<p>As the name suggests, in ours, the changes in our branch are favored  over the other branch during a merge conflict.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>416.	How can we ignore merge  conflicts due to Whitespace?</b></h1>
<p>GIT provides an option ignore-space-change in git merge command  to ignore the conflicts related to whitespaces.</p>
<p>The command to do so is as follows:</p>
<p>git merge -Xignore-space-change whitespace</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>417.	What is git blame?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, git blame is a very good option to find the person who  changed a specific line. When we call git blame on a file, it  displays the commit and name of a person responsible for making  change in that line.</p>
<p>Following is a sample:</p>
<p>public</p>
<p>public</p>
<p>// Prints</p>
<p>$ git blame -L 12,19 HelloWorld.java</p>
<p>^1822fe2 (Dave Adams	2016-03-15 10:31:28 -0700 12)</p>
<p>class HelloWorld {</p>
<p>^1822fe2 (Dave Adams 2016-03-15 10:31:28 -0700 13)</p>
<p>^1822fe2 (Dave Adams 2016-03-15 10:31:28 -0700 14)</p>
<p>static void main(String[] args) {</p>
<p>af6560e4 (Dave Adams 2016-03-17 21:52:20 -0700 16)</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, World&quot; to the terminal window.</p>
<p>a9eaf55d	(Dave	Adams	2016-04-06	10:15:08	-0700	17)</p>
<p>System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World&quot;);</p>
<p>af6560e4 (Dave Adams  2016-03-17 21:52:20 -0700 18)	}</p>
<p>af6560e4 (Dave Adams 2016-03-17 21:52:20 -0700 19) }</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>418.	What is a submodule in GIT?</b></h1>
<p>In GIT, we can create sub modules inside a repository by using git  submodule command.</p>
<p>By using submodule command, we can keep a Git repository as a  subdirectory of another Git repository.</p>
<p>It allows us to keep our commits to submodule separate from the  commits to main Git repository.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>AWS</b></h1>
<p><b>419.	What do you know about AWS  Region?</b></p>
<h2>An AWS Region is a completely independent entity in a  geographical area. There are two more Availability Zones in an  AWS Region.</h2>
<h2>Within a region, Availability Zones are connected through low-  latency links.</h2>
<h2>Since each AWS Region is isolated from another Region, it  provides very high fault tolerance and stability.</h2>
<h2>For launching an EC2 instance, we have to select an AMI within the  same region.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>420.	What are the important  components of IAM?</b></h1>
<p>The important components of IAM are as follows:</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p><b>IAM User</b>: An IAM User is a person or service that will  interact with AWS. User can sign into AWS Management  Console for performing tasks in AWS.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>IAM Group</b>: An IAM Group is a collection of IAM users.  We can specify permission to an IAM Group. This helps in  managing large number of IAM users. We can simply add or  remove an IAM User to an IAM Group to manage the  permissions.</li>
<li><b>IAM Role</b>: An IAM Role is an identity to which we give  permissions. A Role does not have  any credentials  (password or access keys). We can temporarily give an  IAM Role to an IAM User to perform certain tasks in  AWS.</li>
<li><b>IAM Permission: </b>In IAM we can create two types of  Permissions. Identity based and Resource based. We can  create a Permission to access or perform an action on an  AWS Resource and assign it to a User, Role or Group. We  can also create Permissions on resources like S3 bucket,  Glacier vault etc and specify who has access to the  resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>5.</p>
<p><b>IAM Policy</b>: An IAM Policy is a document in which we list  permissions to specify Actions, Resources and Effects. This  document is in JSON format. We can attach a Policy to an  IAM User or Group.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>421.	What are the important points  about AWS IAM?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the important points about AWS IAM are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new User in IAM does not have any permission.</li>
<li>AWS IAM assigns an Access Key and a Secret Access Key to a new  User.</li>
<li>An Access Key cannot be used to login to AWS Console.</li>
<li>We use Access Key to access AWS via an APIs or Command Line  interface.</li>
<li>IAM is a universal application. It is common across all the regions in  AWS.</li>
<li>When we first setup our AWS account, we get a root account that has  complete Admin access.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>422.	What are the important  features of Amazon S3?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the important features of Amazon S3 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon S3 provides unlimited storage for files.</li>
<li>File size in Amazon S3 can vary from 0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes.</li>
<li>We have store files in Buckets in Amazon S3.</li>
<li>In Amazon S3, names of buckets have to be unique globally.</li>
<li>Amazon S3 is Object Based storage.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>423.	What is the scale of durability  in Amazon S3?</b></h1>
<p>Amazon S3 supports durability at the scale of 99.999999999% of time. This is  9 nines after decimal.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>424.	What are the Consistency  levels supported by Amazon S3?</b></h1>
<p>Amazon S3 supports Read after Write consistency when we create a new  object by PUT. It means as soon as we Write a new object, we can access it.</p>
<p>Amazon S3 supports Eventual Consistency when we overwrite an existing  object by PUT. Eventual Consistency means that the effect of overwrite will  not be immediate but will happen after some time.</p>
<p>For deletion of an object, Amazon S3 supports Eventual Consistency after  DELETE.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>425.	What are the different tiers in  Amazon S3 storage?</b></h1>
<p>Different Storage tiers in Amazon S3 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>S3 Standard</b>: In this tier, S3 supports durable storage of files that  become immediately available. This is used for frequently used files.</li>
<li><b>S3 Standard -Infrequent Access (IA): </b>In this tier, S3 provides  durable storage that is immediately available. But in this tier files are  infrequently accessed.</li>
<li><b>S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS)</b>: In this tier, S3 provides  the option to customers to store data at lower levels of redundancy. In  this case data is copied to multiple locations but not on as many  locations as standard S3.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>426.	How will you upload a file  greater than 100 megabytes in  Amazon S3?</b></h1>
<p>Amazon S3 supports storing objects or files up to 5 terabytes. To upload a file  greater than 100 megabytes, we have to use Multipart upload utility from AWS.  By using Multipart upload we can upload a large file in multiple parts.</p>
<p>Each part will be independently uploaded. It doesn’t matter in what order each  part is uploaded. It even supports uploading these parts in parallel to decrease  overall time. Once all the parts are uploaded, this utility makes these as one  single object or file from which the parts were created.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>427.	What happens to an Object  when we delete it from Amazon S3?</b></h1>
<p>Amazon S3 provides DELETE API to delete an object.</p>
<p>If the bucket in which the object exists is version controlled, then we can  specify the version of the object that we want to delete. The other versions of  the Object still exist within the bucket.</p>
<p>If we do not specify the version, and just pass the key name, Amazon S3 will  delete the object and return the version id. And the object will not appear on  the bucket.</p>
<p>In case the bucket is Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled, then the  DELETE request will fail if we do not specify a MFA token.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>428.	What is the use of Amazon  Glacier?</b></h1>
<p>Amazon Glacier is an extremely low cost cloud based storage service  provided by Amazon.</p>
<p>We mainly use Amazon Glacier for long-term backup purpose.</p>
<p>Amazon Glacier can be used for storing data archives for months, years or  even decades.</p>
<p>It can also be used for long term immutable storage based on regulatory and  archiving requirements. It provides Vault Lock support for this purpose. In this  option, we write once but can read many times same data.</p>
<p>One use case is for storing certificates that can be issued only once and only  the original person keeps the main copy.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>429.	Can we disable versioning on a  version-enabled bucket in Amazon  S3?</b></h1>
<p>No, we cannot disable versioning on a version-enabled bucket in Amazon S3.  We can just suspend the versioning on a bucket in S3.</p>
<p>Once we suspend versioning, Amazon S3 will stop creating new versions of  the object. It just stores the object with null version ID.</p>
<p>On overwriting an existing object, it just replaces the object with null version  ID. So any existing versions of the object still remain in the bucket. But there  will be no more new versions of the same object except for the null version ID  object.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>430.	What are the use cases of  Cross Region Replication Amazon  S3?</b></h1>
<p>We can use Cross Region Replication Amazon S3 to make copies of an object  across buckets in different AWS Regions. This copying takes place  automatically and in an asynchronous mode.</p>
<p>We have to add replication configuration on our source bucket in S3 to make  use of Cross Region Replication. It will create exact replicas of the objects  from source bucket to destination buckets in different regions.</p>
<p>Some of the main use cases of Cross Region Replication are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Compliance</b>: Some times there are laws/regulatory requirements that  ask for storing data at farther geographic locations. This kind of  compliance can be achieved by using AWS Regions that are spread  across the world.</li>
<li><b>Failover</b>: At times, we want to minimize the probability of system  failure due to complete blackout in a region. We can use Cross-  Region Replication in such a scenario.</li>
<li><b>Latency</b>: In case we are serving multiple geographies, it makes sense  to replicate objects in the geographical Regions that are closer to end  customer. This helps in reducing the latency.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>431.	Can we do Cross Region  replication in Amazon S3 without  enabling versioning on a bucket?
</b>No, we have to enable versioning on a bucket to perform Cross Region  Replication.</h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>432.	What are the different types of  actions in Object Lifecycle  Management in Amazon S3?</b></h1>
<p>There are mainly two types of Object Lifecycle Management actions in  Amazon S3.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Transition Actions</b>: These actions define the state when an Object  transitions from one storage class to another storage class. E.g. a new  object may transition to STANDARD_IA (infrequent access) class  after 60 days of creation. And it can transition to GLACIER after 180  days of creation.</li>
<li><b>Expiration Actions</b>: These actions specify what happens when an  Object expires. We can ask S3 to delete an object completely on  expiration.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>433.	How do we get higher  performance in our application by  using Amazon CloudFront?</b></h1>
<p>If our application is content rich and used across multiple locations, we can  use Amazon CloudFront to increase its performance. Some of the techniques  used by Amazon CloudFront are as follows:</p>
<p><b>Caching</b>: Amazon CloudFront caches the copies of our application’s content at  locations closer to our viewers. By this caching our users get our content very  fast. Also due to caching the load on our main server decreases.</p>
<p><b>Edge / Regional Locations</b>: CloudFront uses a global network of Edge and  Regional edge locations to cache our content. These locations cater to almost  all of the geographical areas across the world.</p>
<p><b>Persistent Connections</b>: In certain cases, CloudFront keeps persistent  connections with the main server to fetch the content quickly.</p>
<p><b>Other Optimization</b>: Amazon CloudFront also uses other optimization  techniques like TCP initial congestion window etc to deliver high performance  experience.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>434.	What is the mechanism behind  Regional Edge Cache in Amazon  CloudFront?</b></h1>
<p>A Regional Edge Cache location lies between the main webserver and the  global edge location. When the popularity of an object/content decreases, the  global edge location may take it out from the cache.</p>
<p>But Regional Edge location maintains a larger cache. Due to this the  object/content can stay for long time in Regional Edge location. Due to this  CloudFront does not have to go back to main webserver. When it does not find  any object in Global Edge location it just looks for in Regional Edge location.</p>
<p>This improves the performance for serving content to our users in Amazon  CloudFront.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>435.	What are the benefits of  Streaming content?</b></h1>
<p>We can get following benefits by Streaming content:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Control</b>: We can provide more control to our users for what they  want to watch. In a video streaming, users can select the locations in  video where they want to start watching from.</li>
<li><b>Content</b>: With streaming our entire content does not stay at a user’s  device. Users gets only the part they are watching. Once the session is  over, content is removed from the user’s device.</li>
<li><b>Cost</b>: With streaming there is no need to download all the content to a  user’s device. A user can start viewing content as soon as some part  is available for viewing. This saves costs since we do not have to  download a large media file before starting each viewing session.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>436.	What is Lambda@Edge in  AWS?</b></h1>
<p>In AWS, we can use Lambda@Edge utility to solve the problem of low  network latency for end users.</p>
<p>In Lambda@Edge there is no need to provision or manage servers. We can just  upload our Node.js code to AWS Lambda and create functions that will be  triggered on CloudFront requests.</p>
<p>When a request for content is received by CloudFront edge location, the  Lambda code is ready to execute.</p>
<p>This is a very good option for scaling up the operations in CloudFront without  managing servers.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>437.	What are the different types of  events triggered by Amazon  CloudFront?</b></h1>
<p>Different types of events triggered by Amazon CloudFront are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Viewer Request</b>: When an end user or a client program makes an  HTTP/HTTPS request to CloudFront, this event is triggered at the  Edge Location closer to the end user.</li>
<li><b>Viewer Response</b>: When a CloudFront server is ready to respond to  a request, this event is triggered.</li>
<li><b>Origin Request</b>: When CloudFront server does not have the  requested object in its cache, the request is forwarded to Origin  server. At this time this event is triggered.</li>
<li><b>Origin Response</b>: When CloudFront server at an Edge location  receives the response from Origin server, this event is triggered.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>438.	What is Geo Targeting in  Amazon CloudFront?</b></h1>
<p>In Amazon CloudFront we can detect the country from where end users are  requesting our content. This information can be passed to our Origin server by  Amazon CloudFront. It is sent in a new HTTP header.</p>
<p>Based on different countries we can generate different content for different  versions of the same content. These versions can be cached at different Edge  Locations that are closer to the end users of that country.</p>
<p>In this way we are able to target our end users based on their geographic  locations.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>439.	What are the main features of  Amazon CloudFront?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the main features of Amazon CloudFront are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device Detection</li>
<li>Protocol Detection</li>
<li>Geo Targeting</li>
<li>Cache Behavior</li>
<li>Cross Origin Resource Sharing</li>
<li>Multiple Origin Servers</li>
<li>HTTP Cookies</li>
<li>Query String Parameters</li>
<li>Custom SSL</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>440.	What are the security  mechanisms available in Amazon S3?</b></h1>
<p>Amazon S3 is a very secure storage service. Some of the main security  mechanisms available in Amazon S3 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Access</b>: When we create a bucket or an object, only the owner get the  access to the bucket and objects.</li>
<li><b>Authentication</b>: Amazon S3 also support user authentication to  control who has access to a specific object or bucket.</li>
<li><b>Access Control List</b>: We can create Access Control Lists (ACL) to  provide selective permissions to users and groups.</li>
<li><b>HTTPS</b>: Amazon S3 also supports HTTPS protocol to securely  upload and download data from cloud.</li>
<li><b>Encryption</b>: We can also use Server Side Encryption (SSE) in  Amazon S3 to encrypt data.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Cloud Computing</b></h1>
<p><b>441.	What are the benefits of Cloud  Computing?</b></p>
<p>There are ten main benefits of Cloud Computing:</p>
<p>Flexibility: The businesses that have fluctuating bandwidth demands need the  flexibility of Cloud Computing. If you need high bandwidth, you can scale up  your cloud capacity. When you do not need high bandwidth, you can just scale  down. There is no need to be tied into an inflexible fixed capacity  infrastructure.</p>
<p>Disaster Recovery: Cloud Computing provides robust backup and recovery  solutions that are hosted in cloud. Due to this there is no need to spend extra  resources on homegrown disaster recovery. It also saves time in setting up  disaster recovery.</p>
<p>Automatic Software Updates: Most of the Cloud providers give automatic  software updates. This reduces the extra task of installing new software  version and always catching up with the latest software installs.</p>
<p>Low Capital Expenditure: In Cloud computing the model is Pay as you Go.  This means there is very less upfront capital expenditure. There is a variable  payment that is based on the usage.</p>
<p>Collaboration: In a cloud environment, applications can be shared between  teams. This increases collaboration and communication among team members.</p>
<p>Remote Work: Cloud solutions provide flexibility of working remotely. There  is no on site work. One can just connect from anywhere and start working.</p>
<p>Security: Cloud computing solutions are more secure than regular onsite work.  Data stored in local servers and computers is prone to security attacks. In  Cloud Computing, there are very few loose ends. Cloud providers give a  secure working environment to its users.</p>
<p>Document Control: Once the documents are stored in a common repository, it  increases the visibility and transparency among companies and their clients.  Since there is one shared copy, there are fewer chances of discrepancies.</p>
<p>Competitive Pricing: In Cloud computing there are multiple players, so they  keep competing among themselves and provide very good pricing. This comes  out much cheaper compared to other options.</p>
<p>Environment Friendly: Cloud computing saves precious environmental  resources also. By not blocking the resources and bandwidth.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>442.	What is On-demand computing  in Cloud Computing?</b></h1>
<p>On-demand Computing is the latest model in enterprise systems. It is related to  Cloud computing. It means IT resources can be provided on demand by a  Cloud provider.</p>
<p>In an enterprise system demand for computing resources varies from time to  time. In such a scenario, On-demand computing makes sure that servers and IT  resources are provisioned to handle the increase/decrease in demand.</p>
<p>A cloud provider maintains a poll of resources. The pool of resources contains  networks, servers, storage, applications and services. This pool can serve the  varying demand of resources and computing by various enterprise clients.</p>
<p>There are many concepts like- grid computing, utility computing, autonomic  computing etc. that are similar to on-demand computing.</p>
<p>This is the most popular trend in computing model as of now.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>443.	What are the different layers of  Cloud computing?</b></h1>
<p>Three main layers of Cloud computing are as follows:</p>
<p>Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS): IAAS providers give low-level  abstractions of physical devices. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an example  of IAAS. AWS provides EC2 for computing, S3 buckets for storage etc.</p>
<p>Mainly the resources in this layer are hardware like memory, processor speed,  network bandwidth etc.</p>
<p>Platform as a Service (PAAS): PAAS providers offer managed services like  Rails, Django etc. One good example of PAAS is Google App Engineer. These  are the environments in which developers can develop sophisticated software  with ease.</p>
<p>Developers just focus on developing software, whereas scaling and  performance is handled by PAAS provider.</p>
<p>Software as a Service (SAAS): SAAS provider offer an actual working  software application to clients. Salesforce and Github are two good examples  of SAAS. They hide the underlying details of the software and just provide an  interface to work on the system. Behind the scenes the version of Software can  be easily changed.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>444.	What resources are provided  by Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS)  provider?</b></h1>
<p>An IAAS provider can give physical, virtual or both kinds of resources. These  resources are used to build cloud.</p>
<p>IAAS provider handles the complexity of maintaining and deploying these  services.</p>
<p>IAAS provider also handles security and backup recovery for these services.  The main resources in IAAS are servers, storage, routers, switches and other  related hardware etc.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>445.	What is the benefit of Platform  as a Service?</b></h1>
<p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a kind of cloud computing service. A PaaS  provider offers a platform on which clients can develop, run and manage  applications without the need of building the infrastructure.</p>
<p>In PAAS clients save time by not creating and managing infrastructure  environment associated with the app that they want to develop.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>446.	What are the main advantages  of PaaS?</b></h1>
<p>The advantages of PaaS are:</p>
<p>It allows development work on higher level programming with very less  complexity.</p>
<p>Teams can focus on just the development of the application that makes the  application very effective.</p>
<p>Maintenance and enhancement of the application is much easier.</p>
<p>It is suitable for situations in which multiple developers work on a single  project but are not co-located.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>447.	What is the main disadvantage  of PaaS?</b></h1>
<p>Biggest disadvantage of PaaS is that a developer can only use the tools that  PaaS provider makes available. A developer cannot use the full range of  conventional tools.</p>
<p>Some PaaS providers lock in the clients in their platform. This also decreases  the flexibility of clients using PaaS.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>448. What are the different  deployment models in Cloud  computing?</b></h1>
<p>Cloud computing supports following deployment models:</p>
<p>Private Cloud: Some companies build their private cloud. A private cloud is a  fully functional platform that is owned, operated and used by only one  organization.</p>
<p>Primary reason for private cloud is security. Many companies feel secure in  private cloud. The other reasons for building private cloud are strategic  decisions or control of operations.</p>
<p>There is also a concept of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). In VPC, private cloud  is built and operated by a hosting company. But it is exclusively used by one  organization.</p>
<p>Public Cloud: There are cloud platforms by some companies that are open for  general public as well as big companies for use and deployment. E.g. Google  Apps, Amazon Web Services etc.</p>
<p>The public cloud providers focus on layers and application like- cloud  application, infrastructure management etc. In this model resources are shared  among different organizations.</p>
<p>Hybrid Cloud: The combination of public and private cloud is known as  Hybrid cloud. This approach provides benefits of both the approaches- private  and public cloud. So it is very robust platform.</p>
<p>A client gets functionalities and features of both the cloud platforms. By using  Hybrid cloud an organization can create its own cloud as well as they can pass  the control of their cloud to another third party.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>449.	What is the difference between  Scalability and Elasticity?</b></h1>
<p>Scalability is the ability of a system to handle the increased load on its current  hardware and software resources. In a highly scalable system it is possible to  increase the workload without increasing the resource capacity. Scalability  supports any sudden surge in the demand/traffic with current set of resources.</p>
<p>Elasticity is the ability of a system to increase the workload by increasing the  hardware/software resources dynamically. Highly elastic systems can handle  the increased demand and traffic by dynamically commission and  decommission resources. Elasticity is an important characteristic of Cloud  Computing applications. Elasticity means how well your architecture is  adaptable to workload in real time.</p>
<p>E.g. If in a system, one server can handle 100 users, 2 servers can handle 200  users and 10 servers can handle 1000 users. But in case for adding every X  users, if you need 2X the amount of servers, then it is not a scalable design.</p>
<p>Let say, you have just one user login every hour on your site. Your one server  can handle this load. But, if suddenly, 1000 users login at once, can your  system quickly start new web servers on the fly to handle this load? Your  design is elastic if it can handle such sudden increase in traffic so quickly.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>450.	What is Software as a Service?</b></h1>
<p>Software as Service is a category of cloud computing in which Software is  centrally hosted and it is licensed on a subscription basis. It is also known as  On-demand software. Generally, clients access the software by using a thin-  client like a web browser.</p>
<p>Many applications like Google docs, Microsoft office etc. provide SaaS model  for their software.</p>
<p>The benefit of SaaS is that a client can add more users on the fly based on its  current needs. And client does not need to install or maintain any software on  its premises to use this software.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>451.	What are the different types of  Datacenters in Cloud computing?</b></h1>
<p>Cloud computing consists of different types of Datacenters linked in a grid  structure. The main types of Datacenters in Cloud computing are:</p>
<p>Containerized Datacenter</p>
<p>As the name suggests, containerized datacenter provides high level of  customization for an organization. These are traditional kind of datacenters. We  can choose the different types of servers, memory, network and other  infrastructure resources in this datacenter. Also we have to plan temperature  control, network management and power management in this kind of datacenter.</p>
<p>Low-Density Datacenters</p>
<p>In a Low-density datacenter, we get high level of performance. In such a  datacenter if we increase the density of servers, the issue with power comes.  With high density of servers, the area gets heated. In such a scenario, effective  heat and power management is done. To reach high level of performance, we  have to optimize the number of servers’ in the datacenter.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>452.	Explain the various modes of  Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud  environment?</b></h1>
<p>Software as a Service (SaaS) is used to offer different kinds of software  applications in a Cloud environment. Generally these are offered on  subscription basis. Different modes of SaaS are:</p>
<p>Simple multi-tenancy: In this setup, each client gets its own resources. These  resources are not shared with other clients. It is more secure option, since  there is no sharing of resources. But it an inefficient option, since for each  client more money is needed to scale it with the rising demands. Also it takes  time to scale up the application in this mode.</p>
<p>Fine grain multi-tenancy: In this mode, the feature provided to each client is  same. The resources are shared among multiple clients. It is an efficient mode  of cloud service, in which data is kept private among different clients but  computing resources are shared. Also it is easier and quicker to scale up the  SaaS implementation for different clients.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>453.	What are the important things  to care about in Security in a cloud  environment?</b></h1>
<p>In a cloud-computing environment, security is one of the most important  aspects.</p>
<p>With growing concern of hacking, every organization wants to make its  software system and data secure. Since in a cloud computing environment,  Software and hardware is not on the premises of an organization, it becomes  more important to implement the best security practices.</p>
<p>Organizations have to keep their Data most secure during the transfer between  two locations. Also they have to keep data secure when it is stored at a  location. Hackers can hack into application or they can get an unauthorized  copy of the data. So it becomes important to encrypt the data during transit as  well as during rest to protect it from unwanted hackers.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>454.	Why do we use API in cloud  computing environment?</b></h1>
<p>Application Programming Interfaces (API) is used in cloud computing  environment for accessing many services. APIs are very easy to use. They  provide a quick option to create different set of applications in cloud  environment.</p>
<p>An API provides a simple interface that can be used in multiple scenarios.</p>
<p>There are different types of clients for cloud computing APIs. It is easier to  serve different needs of multiple clients with APIs in cloud computing  environment.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>455.	What are the different areas of  Security Management in cloud?</b></h1>
<p>Different areas of Security management in cloud are as follows:</p>
<p>Identity Management: This aspect creates different level of users, roles and  their credentials to access the services in cloud.</p>
<p>Access Control: In this area, we create multiple levels of permissions and  access areas that can be given to a user or role for accessing a service in cloud  environment.</p>
<p>Authentication: In this area, we check the credentials of a user and confirm that  it is the correct user. Generally this is done by user password and multi-factor  authentication like-verification by a one-time use code on cell phone.</p>
<p>Authorization: In this aspect, we check for the permissions that are given to a  user or role. If a user is authorized to access a service, they are allowed to use  it in the cloud environment.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>456.	What are the main cost factors  of cloud based data center?</b></h1>
<p>Costs in a Cloud based data center are different from a traditional data center.  Main cost factors of cloud based data center are as follows:</p>
<p>Labor cost: We need skilled staff that can work with the cloud-based  datacenter that we have selected for our operation. Since cloud is not a very  old technology, it may get difficult to get the right skill people for handling  cloud based datacenter.</p>
<p>Power cost: In some cloud operations, power costs are borne by the client.  Since it is a variable cost, it can increase with the increase in scale and usage.</p>
<p>Computing cost: The biggest cost in Cloud environment is the cost that we pay  to Cloud provider for giving us computing resources. This cost is much higher  compared to the labor or power costs.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>457.	How can we measure the  cloud-based services?</b></h1>
<p>In a cloud-computing environment we pay for the services that we use. So main  criteria to measure a cloud based service its usage.</p>
<p>For computing resource we measure by usage in terms of time and the power  of computing resource.</p>
<p>For a storage resource we measure by usage in terms of bytes (giga bytes) and  bandwidth used in data transfer.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of measuring a cloud service is its availability. A  cloud provider has to specify the service level agreement (SLA) for the time  for which service will be available in cloud.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>458.	How a traditional datacenter is  different from a cloud environment?</b></h1>
<p>In a traditional datacenter the cost of increasing the scale of computing  environment is much higher than a Cloud computing environment. Also in a  traditional data center, there are not much benefits of scaling down the  operation when demand decreases. Since most of the expenditure is in capital  spent of buying servers etc., scaling down just saves power cost, which is very  less compared to other fixed costs.</p>
<p>Also in a Cloud environment there is no need to higher a large number of  operations staff to maintain the datacenter. Cloud provider takes care of  maintaining and upgrading the resources in Cloud environment.</p>
<p>With a traditional datacenter, people cost is very high since we have to hire a  large number of technical operation people for in-house datacenter.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>459.	How will you optimize  availability of your application in a  Cloud environment?</b></h1>
<p>In a Cloud environment, it is important to optimize the availability of an  application by implementing disaster recovery strategy. For disaster recovery  we create a backup application in another location of cloud environment. In  case of complete failure at a data center we use the disaster recovery site to  run the application.</p>
<p>Another aspect of cloud environment is that servers often fail or go down. In  such a scenario it is important to implement the application in such a way that  we just kill the slow server and restart another server to handle the traffic  seamlessly.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>460.	What are the requirements for  implementing IaaS strategy in Cloud?</b></h1>
<p>Main requirements to implement IAAS are as follows:</p>
<p>Operating System (OS): We need an OS to support hypervisor in IaaS. We can  use open source OS like Linux for this purpose.</p>
<p>Networking: We have to define and implement networking topology for IaaS  implementation. We can use public or private network for this.</p>
<p>Cloud Model: We have to select the right cloud model for implementing IaaS  strategy. It can be SaaS, PaaS or CaaS.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>DOCKER</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>461.	What is Docker?</b></h1>
<p>Docker is Open Source software. It provides the automation of  Linux application deployment in a software container.</p>
<p>We can do operating system level virtualization on Linux with  Docker.</p>
<p>Docker can package software in a complete file system that contains  software code, runtime environment, system tools, &amp; libraries that  are required to install and run the software on a server.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>462.	What is the difference between  Docker image and Docker container?</b></h1>
<h2>Docker container is simply an instance of Docker image.</h2>
<h2>A Docker image is an immutable file, which is a snapshot of  container. We create an image with <b>build </b>command.</h2>
<h2>When we use run command, an Image will produce a container.</h2>
<h2>In programming language, an Image is a Class and a Container is an  instance of the class.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>463.	How will you remove an image  from Docker?</b></h1>
<p>We can use docker rmi command to delete an image from our local  system.</p>
<p>Exact command is:</p>
<p>% docker rmi &lt;Image Id&gt;</p>
<p>If we want to find IDs of all the Docker images in our local system,  we can user docker images command.</p>
<p>% docker images</p>
<p>If we want to remove a docker container then we use docker rm  command.</p>
<p>% docker rm &lt;Container Id&gt;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>464.	How is a Docker container  different from a hypervisor?</b></h1>
<p>In a Hypervisor environment we first create a Virtual Machine and  then install an Operating System on it. After that we deploy the  application. The virtual machine may also be installed on different  hardware configurations.</p>
<p>In a Docker environment, we just deploy the application in Docker.  There is no OS layer in this environment. We specify libraries, and  rest of the kernel is provided by Docker engine.</p>
<p>In a way, Docker container and hypervisor are complementary to  each other.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>465.	Can we write compose file in  json file instead of yaml?</b></h1>
<p>Yes. Yaml format is a superset of json format. Therefore any json  file is also a valid Yaml file.</p>
<p>If we use a json file then we have to specify in docker command that  we are using a json file as follows:</p>
<p>% docker-compose -f docker-compose.json up</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>466.	Can we run multiple apps on  one server with Docker?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, theoretically we can run multiples apps on one Docker server.  But in practice, it is better to run different components on separate  containers.</p>
<p>With this we get cleaner environment and it can be used for multiple  uses.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>467.	What are the common use  cases of Docker?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the common use cases of Docker are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Setting up  Development Environment</b>: We can use  Docker to set the development environment with the  applications on which our code is dependent.</li>
<li><b>Testing Automation Setup</b>: Docker  can also help in  creating the Testing Automation setup.  We can setup  different services and apps with Docker to create the  automation testing environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.	<b>Production	Deployment</b>:	Docker</p>
<p>implementing	the	Production	deployment	for</p>
<p>also	helps	in</p>
<p>an</p>
<p>application. We can use it to create the exact environment  and process that will be used for doing the production  deployment.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>468.	What are the main features of  Docker-compose?</b></h1>
<p>Some of the main features of Docker-compose are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Multiple environments on same Host</b>: We can use it to  create multiple environments on the same host server.</li>
<li><b>Preserve Volume Data on Container Creation</b>: Docker  compose also preserves the volume data when we create a  container.</li>
<li><b>Recreate the changed Containers</b>: We can also use  compose to recreate the changed containers.</li>
<li><b>Variables in Compose file</b>: Docker compose also supports  variables in compose file. In this way we can create  variations of our containers.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>469.	What is the most popular use  of Docker?</b></h1>
<p>The most popular use of Docker is in build pipeline. With the use of  Docker it is much easier to automate the development to deployment  process in build pipeline.</p>
<p>We use Docker for the complete build flow from development  work, test run and deployment to production environment.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>470.	What is the role of open source  development in the popularity of  Docker?</b></h1>
<p>Since Linux was an open source operating system, it opened new  opportunities for developers who want to contribute to open source  systems.</p>
<p>One of the very good outcomes of open source software is Docker.  It has very powerful features.</p>
<p>Docker has wide acceptance due to its usability as well as its open  source approach of integrating with different systems.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>UNIX Shell</b></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>471.	How will you remove all files  in current directory? Including the  files that are two levels down in a sub-  directory.</b></h1>
<p>In Unix we have rm command to remove files and sub-directories.  With rm command we have –r option that stands for recursive. The</p>
<p>–r option can delete all files in a directory recursively.</p>
<p>It means if we our current directory structure is as follows:  My_dir</p>
<p>-&gt;Level_1_dir</p>
<p>-&gt; Level_1_dir -&gt;Level_2_dir</p>
<p>-&gt; Level_1_dir -&gt;Level_2_dir-&gt;a.txt</p>
<p>With rm –r * command we can delete the file a.txt as well as sub-  directories Level_1_dir and Level_2_dir.</p>
<p>Command:  rm – r *</p>
<p>The asterisk (*) is a wild card character that stands for all the files  with any name.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>472.	What is the difference between  the –v and –x options in Bash shell  scripts?</b></h1>
<p>In a BASH Unix shell we can specify the options –v and –x on top  of a script as follows:</p>
<p>#!/bin/bash -x –v</p>
<p>With –x option BASH shell will echo the commands like for, select,  case etc. after substituting the arguments and variables. So it will  be an expanded form of the command that shows all the actions of  the script. It is very useful for debugging a shell script.</p>
<p>With –v option BASH shell will echo every command before  substituting the values of arguments and variables. In –v option Unix  will print each line as it reads.</p>
<p>In –v option, If we run the script, the shell prints the entire file and  then executes. If we run the script interactively, it shows each  command after pressing enter.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>473.	What is a Filter in Unix  command?</b></h1>
<h2>In Unix there are many Filter commands like- cat, awk, grep, head,  tail cut etc.</h2>
<h2>A Filter is a software program that takes an input and produces an  output, and it can be used in a stream operation.</h2>
<h2>E.g. cut -d : -f 2 /etc/passwd | grep abc</h2>
<h2>We can mix and match multiple filters to create a complex command  that can solve a problem.</h2>
<h2>Awk and Sed are complex filters that provide fully programmable  features.</h2>
<h2>Even Data scientists use Unix filters to get the overview of data  stored in the files.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>474.	What is Kernel in Unix  operating system?</b></h1>
<p>Kernel is the central core component of a Unix operating system  (OS).</p>
<p>A Kernel is the main component that can control everything within  Unix OS.</p>
<p>It is the first program that is loaded on startup of Unix OS. Once it is  loaded it will manage the rest of the startup process.</p>
<p>Kernel manages memory, scheduling as well as communication with  peripherals like printers, keyboards etc.</p>
<p>But Kernel does not directly interact with a user. For a new task,  Kernel will spawn a shell and user will work in a shell.</p>
<p>Kernel provides many system calls. A software program interacts  with Kernel by using system calls.</p>
<p>Kernel has a protected memory area that cannot be overwritten  accidentally by any process.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>475.	What is a Shell in Unix OS?</b></h1>
<p>Shell in Unix is a user interface that is used by a user to access Unix  services.</p>
<p>Generally a Unix Shell is a command line interface (CLI) in which  users enter commands by typing or uploading a file.</p>
<p>We use a Shell to run different commands and programs on Unix  operating system.</p>
<p>A Shell also has a command interpreter that can take our commands  and send these to be executed by Unix operating system.</p>
<p>Some of the popular Shells on Unix are: Korn shell, BASH, C shell  etc.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>476.	What are the different shells in  Unix that you know about?</b></h1>
<p>Unix has many flavors of Shell. Some of these are as follows:</p>
<p>Bourne shell: We use sh for Bourne shell.</p>
<p>Bourne Again shell: We use bash to run this shell.  Korn shell: We can use ksh to for Korn shell.</p>
<p>Z shell: The command to use this is zsh</p>
<p>C shell: We use csh to run C shell.</p>
<p>Enhanced C shell: tcsh is the command for enhanced C shell.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>477.
What is the first character of the outp  in ls –l command ?</b></h1>
<p>We use ls -l command to list the files and directories in a directory.  With -l option we get long listing format.</p>
<p>In this format the first character identifies the entry type. The entry  type can be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Block special file</li>
<li>Character special file  d		Directory</li>
<p>l	Symbolic link</p>
<p>s	Socket link</p>
<p>p	FIFO</p>
<p>-	Regular file</p>
<p>In general we see d for directory and - for a regular file.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>478.	What is the difference between  Multi-tasking and Multi-user  environment?</b></h1>
<p>In a Multi-tasking environment, same user can submit more than one  tasks and operating system will execute them at the same time.</p>
<p>In a Multi-user environment, more than one user can interact with  the operating system at the same time.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>479.	What is Command  Substitution in Unix?</b></h1>
<p>Command substitution is a mechanism by which Shell passes the  output of a command as an argument to another command. We can  even use it to set a variable or use an argument list in a for loop.</p>
<p>E.g. rm `cat files_to_delete`</p>
<p>In this example files_to_delete is a file containing the list of files to  be deleted. cat command outputs this file and gives the output to rm  command. rm command deletes the files.</p>
<p>In general Command Substitution is represented by back quotes `.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>480.	What is an Inode in Unix?</b></h1>
<p>An Inode is a Data Structure in Unix that denotes a file or a  directory on file system. It contains information about file like-  location of file on the disk, access mode, ownership, file type etc.</p>
<p>Each Inode has a number that is used in the index table. Unix kernel  uses Inode number to access the contents of an Inode.</p>
<p>We can use ls -i command to get the inode number of a file.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>481.	What is the difference between  absolute path and relative path in  Unix file system?</b></h1>
<h2>Absolute path is the complete path of a file or directory from the  root directory. In general root directory is represented by / symbol.  If we are in a directory and want to know the absolute path, we can  use pwd command.</h2>
<h2>Relative path is the path relative the current location in directory.</h2>
<h2>E.g. In a directory structure /var/user/kevin/mail if we are in kevin  directory	then	pwd	command	will	give	absolute	path	as</h2>
<h2>/var/user/kevin.</h2>
<h2>Absolute path of mail folder is /var/user/kevin/mail. For mail  folder ./mail is the relative path of mail directory from kevin folder.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>482.	What are the main  responsibilities of a Unix Shell?
</b>Some of the main responsibilities of a Unix Shell are as follows:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Program Execution: A shell is responsible for executing the  commands and script files in Unix. User can either interactively  enter the commands in Command Line Interface called terminal or  they can run a script file containing a program.</li>
<li>Environment Setup: A shell can define the environment for a user.  We can set many environment variables in a shell and use the value  of these variables in our program.</li>
<li>Interpreter: A shell acts as an interpreter for our scripts. It has a  built in programming language that can be used to implement the  logic.</li>
<li>Pipeline: A shell also can hookup a pipeline of commands. When  we run multiple commands separated by | pipe character, the shell  takes the output of a command and passes it to next one in the  pipeline.</li>
<li>I/O Redirection: Shell is also responsible for taking input from  command line interface (CLI) and sending the output back to CLI.  We use &gt;, &lt;, &gt;&gt; characters for this purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>483.	What is a Shell variable?</b></h1>
<p>A Unix Shell variable is an internal variable that a shell maintains.  It is local to that Shell. It is not made available to the parent shell or  child shell.</p>
<p>We generally use lower case names for shell variables in C shell.  We can set the value of a shell variable by set command.</p>
<p>E.g. % set max_threads=10</p>
<p>To delete a Shell variable we can use unset command.</p>
<p>To use a Shell variable in a script we use $ sign in front of the  variable name.</p>
<p>E.g. echo $max_threads</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Microservices</b></h1>
<p><b>484.	What is a Microservice?</b></p>
<p>A Microservice is a small and autonomous piece of code that does  one thing very well. It is focused on doing well one specific task in  a big system.</p>
<p>It is also an autonomous entity that can be designed, developed and</p>
<p>deployed independently.</p>
<p>Generally, it is implemented as a REST service on HTTP protocol,  with technology-agnostic APIs.</p>
<p>Ideally, it does not share database with any other service.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>485.	What are the benefits of</b></h1>
<p><b>Microservices architecture?</b></p>
<p>Microservices provide many benefits. Some of the key benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling: Since there are multiple Microservices instead of  one monolith, it is easier to scale up the service that is  being used more. Eg. Let say, you have a Product Lookup  service and Product Buy service. The frequency of Product  Lookup is much higher than Product Buy service. In this  case, you can just scale up the Product Lookup service to  run on powerful hardware with multiple servers.  Meanwhile, Product Buy service can remain on less  powerful hardware.</li>
<li>Resilience:	In  Microservice	architecture,	if  your	one</li>
<p>service goes down, it may not affect the rest of the system.  The other parts can keep functioning, business as usual  (BAU). Eg. Let say, you have Product Recommendation  service and Product Buy service. If Product  Recommendation service goes down, the Product Buy  service can still keep running.</p>
<li>Technology Mix: With so many changes in technology</li>
<p>everyday, you can keep using the latest technology for your  new Microservices. You can adopt new technologies with  less risk compared to Monolithic architecture. This is one  of the best benefits of Microservices architecture.</p>
<li>Reuse: Microservices  help you in reusing the lessons</li>
<p>learnt from one service to another.</p>
<li>Easy Deployment: Microservices  architecture, if done  correctly, helps in making the deployment process smooth.  If anything goes wrong, it can be rolled back easily and  quickly in Microservices.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>486.	What is the role of architect in  Microservices architecture?</b></h1>
<p>Architects, in Microservices architecture, play the role of Town  planners. They decide in broad strokes about the layout of the  overall software system.</p>
<p>They help in deciding the zoning of the components. They make sure</p>
<p>components are mutually cohesive but not tightly coupled. They  need not worry about what is inside each zone.</p>
<p>Since they have to remain up to date with the new developments and</p>
<p>problems, they have to code with developers to learn the challenges  faced in day-to-day life.</p>
<p>They can make recommendations for certain tools and technologies,</p>
<p>but the team developing a micro service is ultimately empowered to  create and design the service. Remember, a micro service  implementation can change with time.</p>
<p>They have to provide technical governance so that the teams in their</p>
<p>technical development follow principles of Microservice.</p>
<p>At	times	they	work	as	custodians	of	overall	Microservices  architecture.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>487.	What is the advantage of</b></h1>
<p><b>Microservices architecture over  Service Oriented Architecture  (SOA)?</b></p>
<p>Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an approach to develop  software by creating multiple services. It creates small parts of  services and promotes reusability of software. But SOA  development can be slow due to use of things like communication  protocols SOAP, middleware and lack of principles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Microservices are agnostic to most of these</p>
<p>things. You can use any technology stack, any  hardware/middleware, any protocol etc. as long as you follow the  principles of Microservices.</p>
<p>Microservices architecture also provides more flexibility, stability</p>
<p>and speed of development over SOA architecture.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>488.	Is it a good idea to provide a</b></h1>
<p><b>Tailored Service Template for  Microservices development in an  organization?</b></p>
<p>If your organization is using similar set of technologies, then it is a  good idea to provide a Service Template that can be tailored by  development teams. It can make development faster. Also it can  help in promoting adoption of various good practices that are  already built into template.</p>
<p>But if your organization uses wide variety of technologies, then it</p>
<p>may not be wise to produce and maintain a template for each  service. Instead of that, it is better to introduce tools that help in  maintaining same set of practices related to Microservices among  all such technologies.</p>
<p>There are many organizations that provide tailored templates for</p>
<p>Microservices. Eg. Dropwizard, Karyon etc. You can use these  templates to make faster development of services in your  organization.</p>
<p>Also remember that template code should not promote shared code.</p>
<p>This can lead to tight coupling between Microservices.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>489.	What are the disadvantages of  using Shared libraries approach to  decompose a monolith application?</b></h1>
<h2>You can create shared libraries to increase reuse and sharing of  features among teams. But there are some downsides to it.</h2>
<h2>Since	shared	libraries	are	implemented	in  same	language,	it</h2>
<h2>constrains you from using multiple types of technologies.</h2>
<h2>It does not help you with scaling the parts of system that need better  performance.</h2>
<h2>Deployment of shared libraries is same as deployment of Monolith</h2>
<h2>application, so it comes with same deployment issues.</h2>
<h2>Shared libraries introduce shared code that can increase coupling in  software.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>490.	What are the characteristics of</b></h1>
<p><b>a Good Microservice?</b></p>
<p>Good Microservices have these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loose coupling: A Microservice knows little about any  other service. It is as much independent as possible. The  change made in one Microservice does not require changes  in other Microservices.</li>
<li>Highly cohesive: Microservices are highly cohesive so</li>
<p>that each one of them can provide one set of behavior  independently.</p>
<li>Bounded	Context:	A  Microservice	serves	a	bounded</li>
<p>context in a domain and communicates with rest of the  domain by using an interface for that Bounded context.</p>
<li>Business	Capability:	Microservices	individually	add</li>
<p>business	capability	that	is	part	of	big	picture	in  organization.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>491.	What is Bounded Context?</b></h1>
<p>A bounded context is like a specific responsibility that is developed  within a boundary. In a domain there can be multiple bounded  contexts that are internally implemented. Eg. A hospital system can  have bounded contexts like- Emergency Ward handling, Regular  vaccination, Out patient treatment etc. Within each bounded context,  each sub-system can be independently designed and implemented.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>492.	What are the points to</b></h1>
<p><b>remember during integration of  Microservices?</b></p>
<p>Some of the important points to remember during integration of  Microservices are:</p>
<p>Technology Agnostic APIs: Developing Microservices in a</p>
<p>technology agnostic way helps in integration of multiple  Microservices. With time, the technology implementation can  change but the interface between Microservices can remain same.</p>
<p>Breaking Changes: Every change in Microservice  should  not  become a breaking change for client. It is better to minimize the  impact of a change on an existing client. So that existing clients’ do  not have to keep changing their code to adapt to changes in a  Microservice.</p>
<p>Implementation Hiding: Each Microservice should hide its internal  implementation details from another one. This helps in minimizing  the coupling between Microservices  that are integrated  for a  common solution.</p>
<p>Simple to use: A Microservice should be simple to use for  a  consumer, so that the integration points are simpler. It should allow  clients to choose their own technology stack.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>493.	Is it a good idea for  Microservices to share a common  database?</b></h1>
<p>Sharing a common database between multiple  Microservices  increases coupling between them. One service can start accessing  data tables of another service. This can defeat the purpose of  bounded context. So it is not a good idea to share a common  database between Microservices.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>494.	What is the preferred type of  communication between  Microservices? Synchronous or  Asynchronous?</b></h1>
<p>Synchronous communication is a blocking call in which client  blocks itself from doing anything else, till the response comes back.  In Asynchronous communication, client can move ahead with its  work after making an asynchronous call. Therefore client is not  blocked.</p>
<p>In synchronous communication, a Microservice can provide instant</p>
<p>response about success or failure. In real-time systems, synchronous  service is very useful. In Asynchronous communication, a service  has to react based on the response received in future.</p>
<p>Synchronous systems are also known as request/response based.</p>
<p>Asynchronous systems are event-based.  Synchronous Microservices are not loosely coupled.</p>
<p>Depending on the need and critical nature of business domain,</p>
<p>Microservices can choose synchronous or asynchronous form of  communication.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>495.	What is the difference between</b></h1>
<p><b>Orchestration and Choreography in  Microservices architecture?</b></p>
<p>In Orchestration, we rely on a central system to control and call  various Microservices to complete a task. In Choreography, each  Microservice works like a State Machine and reacts based on the  input from other parts.</p>
<p>Orchestration	is	a	tightly	coupled	approach	for	integrating</p>
<p>Microservices. But Choreography introduces loose coupling. Also,  Choreography based systems are more flexible and easy to change  than Orchestration based systems.</p>
<p>Orchestration is often done by synchronous calls. But choreography</p>
<p>is done by asynchronous calls. The synchronous calls are much  simpler compared to asynchronous communication.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>496.	What are the issues in using  REST over HTTP for Microservices?</b></h1>
<h2>In REST over HTTP, it is difficult to generate a client stub.</h2>
<h2>Some Web-Servers also do not support all the HTTP verbs like-  GET, PUT, POST, DELETE etc.</h2>
<h2>Due to JSON or plain text in response, performance of REST over</h2>
<h2>HTTP is better than SOAP. But it is not as good as plain binary  communication.</h2>
<h2>There is an overhead of HTTP in each request for communication.</h2>
<h2>HTTP is not well suited for low-latency communications.</h2>
<h2>There is more work in consumption of payload. There may be  overhead of serialization, deserialization in HTTP.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>497.	Can we create Microservices  as State Machines?</b></h1>
<p>Yes, Microservices are independent entities that serve a specific  context. For that context, the Microservice can work as a State  Machine. In a State Machine, there are lifecycle events that cause  change in the state of the system.</p>
<p>Eg. In a Library service, there is a book that changes state based on</p>
<p>different events like- issue a book, return a book, lose a book, late  return of a book, add a new book to catalog etc. These events and  book can form a state machine for Library Microservice.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
